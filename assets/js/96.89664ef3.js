Instead,you can tell them something that isn"t\ndirectly related tothe jobposition.\n你最大的缺点是什么？西方老板特别爱问这个问题，让面试者感到很紧张。事实上，他问这个问题是看你对\n棘手问题的反应。你没必要如实回答你的弱点，因为那有可能让你得不到这份工作。相反，你可以告诉他们一些\n与工作不直接相关的事情。\nThird One: Why do you feel you are qualified for this job?\nThis question is a good opportunity to brag a little bit.You should talk about some extra skills\nyou have that maybe wasn"t included in your resume, or talk about your greatest strengthinmore detail.\n你为什么觉得自己胜任这份工作？这时候你要充分发挥你的“自夸”本领。你可以讲述一些简历资料\n里面没有包括的技能；或者是再详细强调一下你的特长。\nFourth One: What kind of salary did you have in mind?\nSalary is how much money you earn, usually per year. When asked this, it"s best to answer with\na salary range or approximation and not an exact figure. This shows that you are familiar with the\nindustry if you know what the approximate salary should be.\n你期望的薪水是多少？“salary”就是你赚多少钱，通常是年收入。回答这个问题时，最好说出一个大致范围，\n而不是一个确切的数字。如果你能说出这个工资范围，那就说明你对此行业非常了解。\nFifth One: If hired, when could you start work?\nWhen answering this it"s best not to say you can start center away. This might make you seem very\ndesperate for a job. A safe answer would be "I can start at the beginning of nextmonth."\n如果雇佣的话，你什么时候开始工作？回答这个问题时。一定要注意！不要说我马上可以工作。那会让对方认为\n你非常迫切地需要这份工作。一个非常保险的回答可以是“Icanstart at the beginning of next month.”（我下月初可以开始上班。）\nSixth One: What kind of work does the posi-tion involve?\nYou can ask this to clarify exactly what kind of work you"llbedoing.\n这个职位包括哪些工作？通过问这句话，你可以清楚地了解到你的工作内容。\n求职过程中面试尤为重要，回答问题，如果能简明扼要，真诚中肯，合乎老外口味，那么录取机会必定大大增加。\n当然，有的问题，也要轻描淡写，以免言多必失，除了要知道和懂得英文简历的表现形式外，还要对英语面试\n常见问题有一个了解。如下，面试中出现频率较高的问题及精彩回答，希望能在您求职路上助您一臂之力。\nQ： Can you sell yourself in two minutes？ Go for it.

I was surprised at their spoken English because\nthey appeared to be a Chinese American. I just couldn\'t decline them.”\n在多人竞争某一职位时，简单的“可以理解的”初级英语层次显然不能够凸显个人实力。\nWilliam Hill先生建议应聘者不妨关注一下自己的英语表达和发音，中国式英语是应该避免的，\n多了解你即将应聘的外企的国家文化，因为每个国家的文化不同会使面试过程的氛围也不同。\n相对来讲美国企业的面试比较relaxing，有点像一般的聊天，只不过聊的内容不是普通的“闲聊”。\n如果在外企英文面试中能准确地融入一些该国的俚语，则你的面试过程将会非常的愉快。\n2、外企招聘时看重哪些英语证书？\n如果外企的面试官是老外的话，那么国内的一些英语考试如CET4、CET6、TEM4、TEM8\n等可能作用并不明显，除了老外不了解这些考试外更多的在于这些考试并没有对考生的口语能力\n进行测试。关于这个问题William Hill说：“I don\'t think candidates with those certificates are up to par,\nbecause what we focus on is the communicating ability. And, as is known, CET and TEM don\'t seem\nto test one\'s speaking skills. But he who owns an IELTS or TOEFL certificate may be preferred.”\n可见雅思、托福等出国英语证书可能在一定程度上增强应聘者的竞争力。\n常见典型问题拆招：\n3、关于介绍自己的：Could you say something about yourself? Could you sell yourself within a few minutes?\n这个问题可以说是大众问题了，通过这个问题，面试官一方面大致把握一下你的英语水平，\n一方面找到和你交流的突破点，探寻本质，打破沙锅是人力资源经理的一惯作风，\n因此回答这个问题时务必事实求是，否则后面很可能无法自圆其说。不过这个问题其实也不复杂，\n外教William Hill告诉我们说与其说这个是测试应聘者的问题，不如说是应聘者卖弄自己\n英语的大好机会，So don\'t miss the boat！\n你可以从以下几个方面突出自己：职业技能强项，该技能的深入程度，该技能完成过的项目\n以及自己其他相关方面的深入研究和学习、探索，注意突出个性。请不要在自己的姓名、年龄、\n毕业学校、兴趣爱好等方面浪费时间，也不用再把你的简历背诵一遍，因为老外已经看过你的CV了。\n时间可以根据情况控制在2-3分钟的样子。注意外企英语面试是口头表达的过程，建议在随后的互动\n过程中多多使用口语化的表达，尽量让自己融入整个对话（Conversation），而不是在教条式的背诵文章。\n4、关于应聘动机的：Why do you wanna work for us? What makes you come here today?\n面试官想了解一下你的求职动机，看看你对公司是否有所了解。显然这个功课是你来面试之前\n就应该做好的，所以千万别说开始面试了还不知道这个公司是做什么的。请在回答这个问题的\n时候充满信心，不要说是来试试的（you really wanna take a try?），如果能事先将公司信息整理\n好并梳理一下和自己的职业技能相结合来介绍，则可谓Perfect Response。\n5、关于你的弱点：What do you think is your greatest weakness? May I know it?\n注意后面那句是客气的，千万别说No，也别说"I don\'t think I have any weakness"。\n客观地评价一下自己确实存在但对工作并不重要的缺点是一个不错的办法，当然别忘了\n要提一下你将采取什么样的办法来克服或弥补自己的缺点。\n6、关于你过去的工作：How do you like your last job? Why did ya leave your last job?\n面试官想通过你对过去的工作的看法，了解你对今后的工作态度。如果你说你不喜欢你过去的\n工作，那么你将面临“既然不喜欢为什么却会选择”这样的难题，最终结果是“缺乏判断力或者没有主见”。\n事实上你既然做过以前的工作，那么应该多少还是比较喜欢的，不妨谈谈过去的工作特点和你所负责\n的主要任务，但要突出过去的工作趋于平淡且失去挑战性，你可以在更艰巨的任务和岗位中发挥能力。\n同时面试官极有可能问你以前的同事和上司的一些问题，切记不要把责任归咎到别人身上。\n7、关于你将来的打算：How long do you propose to work here?\n这个问题对职场老手来说简直就是a piece of cake。简洁的几句话表达出你希望在这个公司一直\n工作下去即可，同时要体现出你的上进心，渴望与公司一起发展和进步，不断提升自己。\n8、反问的机会：Ok, now if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.\n“Nope, I have none, thanks!”这样的回答就完全错了。抓住这个机会，把事先准备好的问题\n和盘托出，多了解一些关于公司发展、职位要求、员工培训、员工晋升、员工福利等方面的问题。\n其实外企英语面试并没有什么特别之处，话题内容上也跳不出中文面试的框框，无非是用英语来\n表达而已。在某些特定职位的招聘上，可能外企更看重的是个人的职业能力而对英语表达要求甚低；\n或者在某些特定的条件下没有太多的竞争者，应聘者不需要具备非常好的英语听说能力就可拿到offer。\n但这些情况并不影响我们对自身竞争力的提升，卓越的英语听说能力必将为你的职场生涯带来裨益。\n一些可能用得上的俚语表达：\n注意:\n1、up to par 达到标准。\n2、I won\'t let the cat out of the bag. 我会严守秘密。\n3、get on the ball 开始（做事）\n4、a piece of cake 形容非常容易\n5、face the music 勇于承担责任')]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"what-is-important-to-you-in-a-job"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#what-is-important-to-you-in-a-job"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" What is important to you in a job?")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Mention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, t\nhe feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"why-do-you-want-to-work-for-this-organization"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#why-do-you-want-to-work-for-this-organization"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Why do you want to work for this organization?")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Cite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working condit\nions.

I hope this work will give me the chance to develop fully.\n我希望这份工作可以给我一个承担职责的机会。在过去十几年的学习生涯中，作为一名学生，我从来没有在真正意义上承担过责任，为一个企业盈利。我认为，人是通过承担一定的责任才能成长、成熟的，我希望这份工作能够给予我发展的机会。\n以上例子从学习和承担职责的角度出发，都十分注重能力的培养，这会让面试官觉得求职者不是一个功利心很强的人，给面试官留下好印象。\n面试：如何应对角色扮演的问题\n角色扮演是各大外企招聘时经常采用的方式之一。回答这类问题的要点是应聘者一定要设身处地、把自己当作角色中的人物。另外，基于任何角色提出的问题根本的目的是要考察应聘者对公司的态度，所以在角色扮演时，要把自己想象成该角色，也要站在全公司的角度来考虑问题，所谓大处着眼、小处着手，方能立于不败之地。\nCase One\nInterviewer: You are a director of our company and you are in charge of a project. There are six people in the project team. Due to different opinions, the team is split into two parts at a meeting and they are debating ferociously. At this time, as a leader, what will you do to coordinate the two parts? If the two parts disagree, what will you do then?\n如果你已经成为我公司的一名主管，由你负责管理一个项目。在该项目的团队中一共有六个人。在一次会议上，由于观点不同，团队分成两派，,进行了激烈的争论，这时，你作为领导者该如何协调？如果两方不能达成共识，你又会怎么办？\nApplicant: First, I will listen to both sides carefully, and make my own judgment. If I prefer one side, I will give facts and data to persuade the other side. If my opinion is between the two sides, I will also give facts and data to prove my opinion right. It is better that the two sides will agree on it. If not, I will stick to my opinion and allow the colleagues who keep reserved opinions to give more data and communicate with me. In short, my principle is that everything should be based on data and facts. Every colleague has the right to express his opinion. I will try my best to make all people agree on one thing. If I fail, I will make my decision, as a leader.\n首先我会仔细聆听双方的观点和理由，并作出我的判断。如果我倾向于其中一方的观点，我会拿出数据和事实来说服另一方；如果我的观点是介于两者之间，我同样会基于数据和事实来证明我的立场。如果最后大家能够达成共识自然最好。如果不能，我会坚持我的观点，但允许持保留意见的同事拿出更多的数据来和我沟通。总之，我的原则是，用数据和事实说话，每一位同事都有权表达他的观点，我会尽量让大家达成共识。如果不行，那作为领导者，我会做出一个决定。\n点评：该求职者能够基于数据和事实说话，既不是独断专行，也不做和事老，这充分表现了他处理问题的成熟程度。\nCase Two\nInterviewer: You are now a team member and if your leader has made a decision but you don't quite agree with this decision and other members don't express any special opinions, what will you do?\n如果你现在是一个项目的团队成员，如果你的领导已经作出了一个决定，但你个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，那你会怎么做？\nApplicant: If my leader has made a decision, but I myself don't quite agree with this decision and other members don't express any special opinion, I will still express my opinion. If the leader doesn't agree with me, I will make my own judgment. If this decision isn't very important, then as a team member, I will act according to what the leader has decided. If this is a key decision, I will gather related information to support my view and try to persuade my leader.\n如果我的领导已经做出了一个决定，但我个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，这时候问我仍然会提出我的意见。如果领导不同意，那我会做出自己的判断。如果我们这个决定并不是十分重要的，那么作为团队成员，我会遵照领导的决定来执行；如果是一个关键的决定，我会搜集相关的材料为我自己的观点寻找支持，力求说服领导。\n点评：虽然只是一个团队成员，但该求职者仍然能够大胆地提出自己地意见，并且能够就问题做出理性的判断，能够让面试官觉得该求职者是真正站在公司的立场上看待问题，并且体现了他处理问题的成熟性。\n－Occupational Experience Experience in auditing, cost accounting and taxation.有审计、成本会计和税务方面的经验。\n－Working experience in foreign company.有在外资公司工作的经验者。\n－Five years' experience in foreign trade or foreignowned venture.有5年在外贸方面或外资企业工作的经验。\n－Experience working with foreign companies.有在外国公司工作的经验。\n－Three years of Experience in personnel recruiting.

Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.”\nWhy Should We Hire You?\nSummarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be a great addition to your team.”\nWhy Do You Want to Work Here?\nThe interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.”\nWhat Are Your Goals?\nSometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.”\nWhy Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job?\nIf you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.”\nIf you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.”\nWhen Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job?\nThe interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.”\nWhat Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t?\nWhat makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102;ormation to be more user-friendly.”\nWhat Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You?\nIt’s time to pull out your old per&＃102;ormance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.”\nWhat Salary Are You Seeking?\nIt is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?”\nIf You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be?\nInterviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get the job done? What impression do you want to make?")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("英文简历攻略\n经常看到有人发翻译简历的贴子。其实我个人认为简历的翻译并没有定式，可自由发挥。但是有一个原则关系到别人看了你的英文简历后对你的英文水平的第一印象，那就是简历中地用词，句子，表达方式等一定要地道。也就是说不能带有太多的所谓中式英语，让别人一看就觉得很不爽。最近我有幸得到一些老外（包括非英语国家）的简历，看了以后颇有收获，拿来共享心得。题目虽然是《完全攻略》，但时间仓促，难免有理解错误，或者不完整的地方还希望大家指正，补充。总的来说，看完这些英文简历给我的感觉是：与其把中文简历翻译成英文，还不如用英文再写一个简历。这样完全按照英文的思维方式和习惯作为出发点写出的简历才会更地道。\n一、简历的结构\n首先，整个简历要分成若干部分：基本情况、自我介绍、教育经历、工作经历等等。这些部分如何分完全凭自己掌握。但是有些不内容是必不可少的。下面就列出我在这些简历上看到的栏目：\n我注意到大部分简历的最上方（标题的位置）都是求职者的姓名和联系方式。也有某些简历用名字作为标题，然后下面的位置写上了自己的求职意向或者联系方式。而有些则是把联系方式做成页眉的效果。和这种方式能让阅读者对此人的姓名联系方式和求职意向一目了然，可以提高效率，并且对求职者有比较深刻的印象。由此可见她们的共同点是：大多以姓名作为大标题，然后再显眼的地方注明联系方式和求职意向。\n接下来算是简历的正文。所有的简历都把教育经历放在首位。看来教育背景还是对方关注的首要问题。教育背景是按照时间倒序排列的，最近的放在最上面。有的是时间写在前面，紧跟学校、专业作为条目的标题，或者把学校、专业放前面，后面跟时间。标题下面是具体的介绍。\n然后是工作经历，格式和教育背景基本一致。某些简历在教育背景和工作经历之间还加上了学过的和专业相关的课程，培训班等。而在工经理后面还可以加上参加过的志愿者工作等。\n以上是简历中的重头戏。接下来的内容大多是自己掌握的技能，语言能力和计算机能力。有时还有个人爱好等更全面介绍自己的内容。\n二、简历的用词翻译\n下面列出一些中英文对照（有的地方可以用多个英文单词表示，用 '|' 隔开，这里列出的只是简历中出现的，也许并不仅限于这些）：\n求职意向 ------- Objective\nObjective这个词在电脑游戏中出现的频率很高。一般是作为每关之前的任务介绍。直译就是目标、目的。如果有Objective，一般放在正文的第一栏。\n教育背景 --------Education | Education and Qualifications\n都用这个，background就不要加上了，有点中式英语的嫌疑。如果包含了一些认证培训之类的，可以写成 Education and Qualifications.\n个人介绍、自我评价 -------- PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS | SYNOPSIS\nSYNOPSIS这个词比较笼统，内容可以自由些，包括个人性格，目前状况等。\nPERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS 偏重于介绍自己的优势、优点等。\n工作经历 ---------- Experience | Work(ing) Experience | JOB EXPERIENCE | EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE\n这些都是大同小异。也有个人用 EMPLOYMENT HIGHLIGHTS。\n我注意到有个人在Work Experience 的位置用了 Research Experience， 再细看内容才发现此人的经历都是研究性质的工作，包括在大学期间从事的一些研究。\n参加过的活动（包括校内） -------------- ACTIVITIES\nACTIVITIES最普遍，所有的活动都包括了，比较好用。\nCampus Involvement & Activities 这里加上compus 那就仅限于在学校的。这里的 Involvement 我猜想指的是参加社团或者某个组织的这种长期的活动。而Activities则不限。\n荣誉、奖励 -------- Honors | Awards\n有些干脆就用 Honors & Awards\n剩下的一些\n技能 ---- Skills | Additional Skills\n爱好 ----- HOBBIES\n计算机技能 ------ Computer Skills 也可以作为Skills的一部分。\n志愿者经历 ----- VOLUNTEERING\n接下来介绍一下具体内容的翻译。\n流利使用某种语言： Fluent in XXX\n普通话： Mandarin Chinese\n熟悉......：Familiar with....\n精通.... ：proficient with | Advanced Skills in.... | Advanced Software User： （列出精通使用的软件名称）\n个人、人： individual （注意不要用person什么的）\n关于语言能力的： Daily Spoken （经常使用的）， Training Obtained（受过培训的---我想不仅限于语言能力）")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"三、总结"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#三、总结"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 三、总结")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("这些简历给我的最大感受是，简练。没有废话，有些地方甚至省略掉主语例如： Activities: President of College Democrats，中文简历中一般会说“曾担任校学生会主席”，而你要死板的翻译成英文就很罗嗦：“ I've been the President of the Students' Union of the college” ，不如就说 “President of the Students' Union ”，能简单尽量简单，至于是校学生会，还是系学生会不必在乎，再说真的在乎的话面试的时候有机会的。而且语言简练不容易出错，何乐而不为。\n在碰到一些不太好翻译的词汇时，不用着急，可以自己创造，只要能正确表达出中文词汇的含义即可。毕竟两种语言之间不是映射表的关系。\n我看到一份简历在Education后面还加上了，Double Majors 和 Higher Level Course Work， 这样把突出的教育经历或者工作经历单独列出来，容易引起关注，是个好方法。\n总之，要做到简练，结构清楚，表达明确，不出现错误，就是一个合格的英文简历。")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"英文求职信七步写作法"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#英文求职信七步写作法"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 英文求职信七步写作法")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("求职信分为推荐信和自荐信两种，它是书面表达的重要体裁之一，也是高考书面表达的热点内容。写求职信可按下列七个步骤进行。下面举例说明：\n假设你叫李平，你从报上得知某公司欲招聘一名英语翻译，请你给该公司经理写一份求职信，你的个人资料如下：\n1.简况：姓名，李平；年龄，30岁；身高，1.80米；健康状况，良好；业余爱好，游泳、唱歌、跳舞。\n2.简历：1994年北京大学毕业后分配到南通中学工作，1996年调至苏州中学工作至今。\n3.工作：工作认真负责，与人相处融洽。\n4.特长：精通英语，尤其口语，已将多本中文书籍译成英语，懂一些日语、能用日语与外宾对话。\n联系电话：3654 7557\n联系地址：苏州市人民路75号")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"第一步-介绍消息来源"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#第一步-介绍消息来源"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 第一步：介绍消息来源")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("介绍消息来源实际上是求职信的开篇交待句，它可使求职信显得自然、顺畅；而不介绍消息来源，会使收信人感到意外、突然，文章也缺乏过渡、照应，本文消息来源可作如下介绍：\nDear manager,\nI learned from the newspaper that your company wanted to hire an English translator.")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"第二步-表明求职心愿"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#第二步-表明求职心愿"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 第二步：表明求职心愿")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("介绍完消息来源后，应向收信人表明自己的求职心愿，即写信的目的，本文求职心愿可作如下介绍：\nI'm interested in this job very much.
