biggest challenges of covering Elizabeth\'s life and reign has long involved balancing admiration for her sense of public duty with the changing attitudes toward the monarchy.\n\n> 长久以来，报道伊丽莎白的生活和统治的最大的挑战就在于长期涉及到需要平衡对她的公共责任感的钦佩和对君主制度态度的变化。\n> \n> covering Elizabeth：报道伊丽莎白\n> \n> long involved：长期涉及\n> \n> admiration：钦佩\n> \n> monarchy：君主制度\n> \n> reign：统治\n\nOf course, in the wake of the death of such a figure, the impetus is all the more compelling to only bring praise.\n\n> 当然，在这样一个人物去世的唤醒仪式上， 赞扬的动力只会更加强烈。\n> \n> wake of the death：貌似是基督教中死后的唤醒仪式的意思，女王是信基督的\n> \n> impetus：动力\n> \n> all the more：更加\n> \n> compelling：非常强烈的，引人入胜的，不可抗拒的\n> \n> praise：赞扬\n\nBut media generally found ways to sing her praises while not ignoring criticism of her family.\n\n>

off when on holiday?\n\nrecent research conducted by uk cyber-security firm tessian, which spoke to 1, 000 employees in companies that employ at least 100 staff, found that more than half of uk employees feel there is an expectation within their organisation to reply to emails quickly. and six out of 10 employees use their mobile phones to send emails during out-of-office hours. since the blackberry phone first gained popularity about 15 years ago, there has been a gradual expectation that if you have access to technology that enables you to reply to messages instantly and makes you always contactable, then people should be able to reply quickly, even outside office hours. \"lots of people's bosses are checking their emails during their holidays, and that sets an expectation for employees to do it too, \" david d'souza, membership director of the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd), told the bbc. chris harding, chief executive of actual group, says he discusses this topic with his team a lot, but there is \"no definitive right or wrong\" answer. \"you don't really fully relax not knowing what's going on. however, some may relax more if they are totally detached from the business, \" he says. mr d'souza says some departments have started restricting people's access to email while they are on holiday. for instance, daimler in germany has introduced a policy that if you try to email a person who is on annual leave, the email will be deleted. \"organisations benefit from people who return from holidays being fully rested, \" mr d'souza stresses. \"we need to have a better relationship with technology and make sure we aren't addicted or getting too much screen time. and secondly, we know that people's productivity dips if they're not adequately rested within work.\"",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/01/27

against global scorn\n\naug.28 · 2019\n\nthe brazilian government is pushing back against mounting national and international pressure over its environmental policies as a record number of fires rip through the amazon rain forest.\n\ngermany and norway have already suspended their contributions to a rain forest preservation fund, and polls indicate that even among president jair bolsonaro’s own voters there is overwhelming support for stronger measures to combat illegal deforestation.\n\ndata from the national institute of space research showed an 84% year-on-year increase in forest fires in 2019, many caused by loggers incentivized by the government’s disdain for environmental oversight.\n\nwhile bolsonaro relishes criticism of his attitude toward the amazon — jokingly referring to himself as “captain chainsaw” — his supporters in the agricultural sector fear a backlash from consumers both in brazil and abroad.\n\nsenior figures in brazil’s agricultural sector have warned the president of the potential economic repercussions of his policies, though so far bolsonaro himself has shown little sign of paying heed. one of the key concerns is the possible impact on the recent trade deal agreed between the european union and the south american customs union, mercosur.\n\n“the mercosur-eu deal hasn’t been ratified yet and there are requirements in it about sustainability and the protection of the indigenous, for example, ” renata amaral, director of international trade at the barral mjorge consultancy, said.",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/01/27

history by stitching together a colon, a hyphen and a close parenthesis ("😃").\n\nwith that smiley face, fahlman attempted to solve a familiar problem to today\'s internet users: conveying sarcasm online.\n\n\n# the evolution from 😃 to 😂\n\napple added an official emoji keyboard available outside japan in 2011, a milestone that emoji experts credit as the true entrance of the characters into the american online lexicon. by 2015, the face with tears of joy emoji 😂 was named the oxford dictionary\'s word of the year. this emoji remains the favorite among us users, according to an adobe study.\n\n\n# the future of emoji\n\njust as language evolves, so too have emoji.\n\nunicode puts out emoji set updates each september after sifting through submitted proposals and responding to global trends.\n\nbut unicode has also faced criticism over the years for its lack of race, gender, sexuality and disability representation in earlier emoji sets, leading to the release of five skin tone options in 2015 and two gender options for professions in 2016. accessibility emojis were added in 2019.\n\nwhile there are now thousands of emoji options, the main usage remains loyal to the original goal 40 years ago of adding a smile and some levity.\n\nas for fahlman, he uses emojis "very, very rarely." mostly, he said, "i prefer the little text ones, partly because they\'re my

the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, leads the other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th CPC Central Committee in meeting the press at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday, Oct 23, 2022.\n\n> 2022年10月23日，中国共产党中央委员会总书记习近平，带领中国共产党二十大新任的政治局常务委员在人民大会堂接受采访。\n\nThe new Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee was elected at the first plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on Sunday.\n\n> 中国共产党中央委员会新任政治局常务委员会，在周日的中共第20届中央委员会第一次全体会议上被选举出来。\n> \n> Standing Committee：常务委员会（standing有站着的意思，一直站着，代表常务\n> \n> Political Bureau：政治局\n> \n> plenary：全体\n> \n> 20th CPC Central Committee：中国共产党第二十届中央委员\n\nAs the seven members of the Standing Committee strode into the spotlight at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday at noon, it marked the start of the next stage of China's journey to build itself into a modern socialist country by 2035, and to become a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century.\n\n> 在周日下午，当七名常务委员迈步走进北京人民大会堂的聚光灯下时，标志着中国开始进入下一阶段的发展之路，在2035年将中国建设成一个社会主义现代化国家，并且在这个世纪的中叶全面建成社会主义现代化强国。\n> \n>

respects：所有方面\n\nWith the realization of the goal of the great rejuvenation of the nation on the horizon, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the new leadership of the Party to inspire the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to forge ahead on the Chinese path to modernization.\n\n> 随着民族伟大复兴目标的实现即将到来，领航我国各族人民群众砥砺前行，走中国现代化道路的责任落到了党的新一届领导的肩上。\n> \n> realization：实现\n> \n> rejuvenation：复兴\n>

expressing appreciation for the trust the Party had placed in them to fulfill this responsibility during the Standing Committee's first collective meeting with the media on Sunday, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping, on behalf of the new leadership of the Party, emphasized that they will always bear in mind the nature and purpose of the Party and its missions, and promised they will work diligently to fulfill their duties and not betray the great trust placed in them by the Party and the people.\n\n> 这就是为什么，常任委员在周日的第一次全体会见媒体时，对党任命他们（成为常委）履行如此责任的信任表示感谢，中国共产党中央委员会总书记习近平，作为党内的新一届领导代表，强调他们（我党）将会时刻牢记党的性质与目的以及它的任务，并且承诺他们将会努力工作去履行他们的使命，绝不背叛党和人民对他们的极大信任。\n> \n> expressing appreciation：表示感谢\n> \n> had

National Congress of the CPC stated that on the road ahead, the new leading group must firmly uphold and strengthen the overall leadership of the Party, adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and people-centered development, deepen reform and opening-up, and carry forward the spirit of struggle.\n\n> 这也是为什么在党的20大决议指出，在今后的道路上，新的领导集体一定要坚决拥护和加强党的全面领导，坚持走中国特色社会主义道路和以人为本的发展道路，深化改革开放，弘扬斗争精神。\n> \n> Resolution：决议\n> \n> the 20th National Congress of the CPC：中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会\n> \n> National：国家的、全国的\n> \n>

in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, have been drawn from and tested over the past 10 decades since the Party was founded. Over the past 10 years, the Party's leadership, with Xi at its core, has effectively coped with the huge risks and challenges that have resulted from the complex international situation, pushed forward socialism with Chinese characteristics and made remarkable achievements in the cause of the Party and the country.\n\n> 这些思想精神，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义的思想结晶，是自建党100多年来的总结和检验。再过去的十年中，在以习近平为核心的党的领导下，有效的克服了由于复杂的国际局势导致的巨大风险和挑战，推进发展中国特色社会主义，并在党和国家的事业中取得了显著的成就。\n> \n> principle：道德原则，行为准则，规范、思想精神\n> \n> crystallize：结晶（例如思想结晶\n> \n> New Era：新时代 （era n.时代、纪元、时期\n> \n> draw from：从..中总结、汲取\n> \n> test：检验\n> \n> cope with：克服（困难\n> \n> have resulted from：由…导致\n> \n> cause：n. 事业、原因\n\nThat has made the Party stronger and more capable, the Chinese people more confident and united, and the connections between the two more inseparable and focused. As a result, as the Resolution of the 20th CPC National Congress noted, socialism with Chinese characteristics is demonstrating its vitality and potential in the new era, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has become an irreversible historical process.\n\n> 这使得党更加强大和有能力，中国人民更加自信与团结，并且二者的连接更紧密，目标也更加明确。因此，正如20大决议所指出的那样，中国特色社会主义在新时代证明了它的生命力与潜能，中华民族的伟大复兴将会成为不可逆转的历史进程。\n> \n>

irreversible：不可逆转的\n\nThe numerous congratulatory messages the Party has received from around the world on the successful conclusion of its 20th CPC National Congress speak volumes of the great hopes that members of the international community, in particular those of the Global South, have pinned on it in the expectation that it will carry forward its legacy and break new ground in fulfilling its mission of serving the Chinese people and promoting the common development of humankind.\n\n> 党从世界各地收到很多祝贺二十大成功闭幕的消息，充分说明了国际社会成员，特别是全球南方的国家寄予的厚望，希望它能够发扬自己的传统，在执行为中国人民服务的任务上开辟新天地（这段奇奇怪怪）、促进人类共同发展的使命方面开辟新的天地。\n> \n> numerous：很多的\n> \n> congratulatory：祝贺的\n> \n> conclusion：结论、结束、结尾\n> \n>

effectively overcome all the difficulties and challenges the country has faced on the journey so far, confidence is high that the new leadership will not only be able to adapt the new development philosophy to the changing times and lead the country's continued advance on the road to modernization, but also make more contributions to world peace and development.\n\n> 在展示了有效克服国家迄今为止所面临的困难和挑战的智慧和决心之后，人们对新的领导层不仅能够使新的发展理念适应不断变化的时代，并带领该国在现代化道路上继续前进充满信心，也为世界和平与发展做出了更多贡献。\n> \n> demonstrated：论证\n> \n> wisdom ：智慧\n> \n> resolve：决定、决心\n> \n> overcome：克服\n> \n> has faced on

that China will continue to work together with all peace-loving nations to safeguard world peace and promote global development through wider opening-up, and that it will continue to contribute Chinese wisdom and solutions to address the pressing global challenges and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\n> 在党的强有力的领导下，毫无疑问，中国将会持续与所有热爱和平的国家一道，通过扩大开放，去维护世界的和平和促进全球发展，并将会为应对不断加剧的全球压力，推动构建人类命运共同体贡献中国智慧和解决方案。\n> \n> safeguard：v.保护\n> \n> address：应对、设法解决、地址（你没看错，是同一个词\n> \n> community with a shared future for

nature and purpose of the party and its missions, and promised they will work diligently to fulfill their duties and not betray the great trust placed in them by the party and the people.\n\nthat's also why the resolution of the 20th national congress of the cpc stated that on the road ahead, the new leading group must firmly uphold and strengthen the overall leadership of the party, adhere to the path of socialism with chinese characteristics and people-centered development, deepen reform and opening-up, and carry forward the spirit of struggle.\n\nthese principles, crystallized in xi jinping thought on socialism with chinese characteristics for a new era, have been drawn from and tested over the past 10 decades since the party was founded. over the past 10 years, the party's leadership, with xi at its core, has effectively coped with the huge risks and challenges that have resulted from the complex international situation, pushed forward socialism with chinese characteristics and made remarkable achievements in the cause of the party and the country.\n\nthat has made the party stronger and more capable, the chinese people more confident and united, and the connections between the two more inseparable and focused. as a result, as the resolution of the 20th cpc national congress noted, socialism with chinese characteristics is demonstrating its vitality and potential in the new era, and the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation has become an irreversible historical process.\n\nthe numerous congratulatory messages the party has received from around the world on the successful conclusion of its 20th cpc national congress speak volumes of the great hopes that members of the international community, in particular those of the global south, have pinned on it in the expectation that it will carry forward its legacy and break new ground in fulfilling its mission of serving the chinese people and promoting the common development of humankind.\n\nhaving demonstrated the wisdom and resolve to effectively overcome all the difficulties and challenges the country has faced on the journey so far, confidence is high that the new leadership will not only be able to adapt the new development philosophy to the changing times and lead the country's continued advance on the road to modernization, but also make more contributions to world peace and development.\n\nunder the strong leadership of the party, there is no doubt that china will continue to work together with all peace-loving nations to safeguard world peace and promote global development through wider opening-up, and that it will continue to contribute chinese wisdom and solutions to address the pressing global challenges and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nif you have any problems with this article, please contact us at app@chinadaily.com.cn and we'll immediately get back to

治疗；治好；治愈；解决。\n\n② our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.\n\nto部分是不定式后置定语，修饰failure\n\nconfront vt. 面对；遭遇\n\nthat reality指死亡\n\nthreaten vt. 威胁\n\ngreatness n. 伟大\n\n总结：第一段是说，过去一个世纪里，美国的医疗技术（水平）确实提高了很多，这个让人们过上了高质量的生活。但是，再伟大的医疗体系，也医不好死亡，就是该死的肯定要死，而不是，第一句话说的，死亡也可以选择。所以，第一句话表明美国人对自己的医疗技术的过度自信。但是，我们却不敢直接面对死亡。这会阻止人类变得伟大。\n\n第二段\n\n①Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. ②We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. ③Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. ④The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. ⑤Physicians—frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified. 死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\n①Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. 死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。\n\n这是两句话，用分号连接\n\nnormal adj. 正常的\n\n② we are

death as a problem to be solved. 在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。\n\n这是两句话，用yet来连接\n\nthat指上一句说的内容\n\nat some level：在某种程度上\n\nas medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved.\n\nmedical adj. 医疗的；医学的\n\ntreat A as B：把A看作B；认为A是B\n\nto部分是不定式后置定语，修饰problem\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，人们还是不想死，不想面对死亡的现实，希望死亡这个问题可以被解决，这样大家都不用死了。\n\n③Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. 因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。\n\nshield部分是分词状语，这里表示：“原因”\n\nshield n. 盾；盾牌；保护人；vt. 保护；遮挡\n\nthird-party n. 第三方\n\npayer n. 支付者；付款者\n\ncare在这里指的是“医疗保险”，就是由医保来支付\n\n主句部分：we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless.\n\ndemand vt. 要求\n\nthat部分是定语从句，修饰everything\n\neven if部分是让步状语从句\n\nuseless adj. 无用的\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，因为，医疗费用是由第三方出的，而且，我们害怕死亡，所以，我们会要求一切，只要能用的，都给我们用上。但是，其实很多时候，都是无用的，要死的终究要死，这是无法逃避的。在死亡面前，没有任何人有选择的权利。\n\n④The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. 最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。\n\nlate-stage n. 晚起；末期\n\ncancer n. 癌症。\n\n⑤Physicians—frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified. 医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\nphysician n. 医生；内科医生\n\nfrustrated部分是分词后置定语，修饰“医生”，frustrate vt. 挫败；沮丧\n\ninability n. 无能\n\n主句部分：Physicians too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.\n\naggressive adj. 好斗的；进取的；好强的，这里表示过度的治疗。\n\nfar部分是形容词短语修饰treatment\n\nwhat后面是beyond的宾语从句。\n\nscientifical adj. 科学的。—— scientifically adv. 合乎科学地。\n\njustified adj. 合理的。\n\n总结：第二段是说，人们害怕死亡，而且，医疗费用也是由第三方支付的，所以，在看病的时候，往往都是要求医生，能用的治疗都用上，比如：癌症晚期的治疗，医生往往会对自己无力治愈这种疾病感到沮丧，而且，也害怕病人失去希望，所以，经常提供过多的治疗。但是，这些其实都是没有用的，只是浪费医疗资源而已，让病人感觉有希望，而不是治愈死亡。死亡是治不好的。\n\n第三段\n\n①In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. ②In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. ③Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. ④Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. ⑤Some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so. ⑥Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential. 1950年，美国在医疗保健上花费了127亿美元。到2002年，医疗保健花费将达到1.54万亿美元。任何人都可以看出这种趋势是不可持续的。然而，似乎很少有人愿意试图扭转这一局面。一些学者认为，资源有限的政府应该停止为超过一定年龄的人（比如83岁左右）支付医疗费用。美国科罗拉多州前州长理查德•拉姆曾说过，年老体弱的人“有责任死去，让出位置位来”，让更年轻、更健康的人可以实现自己的健康潜力。\n\n①In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. 1950年，美国在医疗保健上花费了127亿美元。\n\nhealth care：医疗保健\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里的费用高，就是因为过多的治疗。但是，往往是没有用的。但是，因为，人们害怕死亡，所以，还是提供过多的治疗。\n\n②In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. 到2002年，医疗保健花费将达到1.54万亿美元。\n\n③Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. 任何人都可以看出这种趋势是不可持续的。\n\nthis trend指前两句说的医疗保健花费越来越高这件事情\n\nsustain vt. 维持；保持；遭受；经受；支撑；证实。—— sustainable adj. 合理利用的；可持续的。—— unsustainable adj. 不能持续的；不能维持的。\n\n④Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. 然而，似乎很少有人愿意试图扭转这一局面。\n\nwilling adj. 愿意的；乐意的\n\nreverse vt. 颠倒；彻底改变；废除；撤销。\n\n⑤Some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so. 一些学者认为，资源有限的政府应该停止为超过一定年龄的人（比如83岁左右）支付医疗费用。\n\nscholar n. 学者。—— scholarship n. 奖学金；学术；学术研究\n\nthat部分是宾语从句：a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so.\n\nwith部分是介词短语修饰government（政府）\n\nfinite adj. 有限的。—— infinite adj. 无限的\n\nresource n. 资源（这里指的是医疗资源）\n\nmedical care：医疗；医学治疗。\n\nthat部分是定语从句，修饰care：that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so.\n\nsay vt. 例如。\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，政府的医疗资源也是有限的，经不起想怎么治疗就怎么治疗这样的浪费，所以，如果某人超过某个年纪以后，政府就不再为其支付医疗费用了。就是说，让他死了算了。\n\n⑥Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential. 美国科罗拉多州前州长理查德•拉姆曾说过，年老体弱的人 “有责任死去，让出位置位来”，让更年轻、更健康的人可以实现自己的健康潜力。\n\ngovernor n. 州长\n\nquote

责任\n\nget out the way：让开；让路；让出位置。\n\nso that后面是结果状语从句：younger, healthier people can realize their potential.\n\nrealize vt. 实现\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，那些老人，该死的就赶紧死，这样，好腾出地方来给年轻的人。\n\n总结：第三段是说，美国政府的医疗花费越来越高，这就让人们开始议论，是不是可以取消某些人的医疗支付，当他们超过一定年纪的时候。而且，有人认为，那些体弱的老人，有责任去死，这样可以腾出位置给年轻人。\n\n第四段\n\n①I would not go that far. ②Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and remain dazzlingly productive. ③At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be 53. ④Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor is in

As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people’s lives. 即：日本和瑞典投入更少，但是，他们的人民活得更长、更健康。而美国则是把钱投到了那些不可能治愈的疾病上，而不是，投入到那个改善人们生活的治疗上。这表明美国的投入是不合理的。反之，日本和瑞典的投入更加合理。所以，D正确。\n\nA. more flexibly更灵活\n\nB. more extravagantly更多奢侈\n\nC. more cautiously更为谨慎\n\nD. more reasonably更合理\n\n 60.

文章意在表达这样的思想\n\n解释：\n\nA答案：无中生有。这就是长生不老的药，文章没有说到。\n\nB答案：无中生有。\n\nC答案：本文从第一句话就开说关于死亡的问题，即：在美国死亡是可以选择的，但是，其实不是，是因为美国人害怕死亡。然后，因为，美国的医疗发达，所以，美国人在医治诸如癌症这样不可治愈的疾病上，投入巨大，往往为这样的病人提供过多的治疗。这样造成了大量不合理的医疗投入。文章从第二段开始就说，死亡是一件很正常的事情，那些昂贵的治疗都是没有用的，下文也说，该死的，就死吧，不要占着位置。而且，死亡是不可治愈的，很多随着年纪增大带来的问题都是可以管理的，在这些方面日本和瑞典做得就比美国好。所以，本文试图要传达的就是死亡是不可治愈的，死亡是必然的，任何治疗都是浪费。所以，C正确。\n\nD答案：是文章的内容，但是，不是本文的目的，本文的目的就是要借助不断的需求造成的投入的增加来说明死亡是不可避免的，因为，这些医疗投入都是浪费掉的，没有必要的。就是拿再多的钱去医治一个癌症晚期的人，都是医不好的，只是浪费资源。\n\nA.

死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\n①death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. 死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。\n\n这是两句话，用分号连接\n\nnormal adj. 正常的\n\n② we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions.\n\ngene n. 基因。—— genetic adj. 基因的；遗传的。—— genetically adv. 基因方面地；从基因的角度看\n\nprogramme n. 程序。 —— programmed adj. 程序化的（这里说必定的）\n\nintegrate vt. 整合；使成为一体。—— disintegrate vt. 破裂；解体；瓦解。\n\nperish vi. 死亡；毁灭\n\neven部分是让步状语\n\nideal adj. 理想的\n\n②we all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. 在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。\n\n这是两句话，用yet来连接\n\nthat指上一句说的内容\n\nat some level：在某种程度上\n\nas medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved.\n\nmedical adj. 医疗的；医学的\n\ntreat a as b：把a看作b；认为a是b\n\nto部分是不定式后置定语，修饰problem\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，人们还是不想死，不想面对死亡的现实，希望死亡这个问题可以被解决，这样大家都不用死了。\n\n③shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. 因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。\n\nshield部分是分词状语，这里表示：“原因”\n\nshield n. 盾；盾牌；保护人；vt. 保护；遮挡\n\nthird-party n. 第三方\n\npayer n. 支付者；付款者\n\ncare在这里指的是“医疗保险”，就是由医保来支付\n\n主句部分：we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless.\n\ndemand vt. 要求\n\nthat部分是定语从句，修饰everything\n\neven if部分是让步状语从句\n\nuseless adj. 无用的\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，因为，医疗费用是由第三方出的，而且，我们害怕死亡，所以，我们会要求一切，只要能用的，都给我们用上。但是，其实很多时候，都是无用的，要死的终究要死，这是无法逃避的。在死亡面前，没有任何人有选择的权利。\n\n④the most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. 最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。\n\nlate-stage n. 晚起；末期\n\ncancer n. 癌症。\n\n⑤physicians—frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified. 医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\nphysician n. 医生；内科医生\n\nfrustrated部分是分词后置定语，修饰“医生”，frustrate vt. 挫败；沮丧\n\ninability n. 无能\n\n主句部分：physicians too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.\n\naggressive adj. 好斗的；进取的；好强的，这里表示过度的治疗。\n\nfar部分是形容词短语修饰treatment\n\nwhat后面是beyond的宾语从句。\n\nscientifical adj. 科学的。—— scientifically adv. 合乎科学地。\n\njustified adj. 合理的。\n\n总结：第二段是说，人们害怕死亡，而且，医疗费用也是由第三方支付的，所以，在看病的时候，往往都是要求医生，能用的治疗都用上，比如：癌症晚期的治疗，医生往往会对自己无力治愈这种疾病感到沮丧，而且，也害怕病人失去希望，所以，经常提供过多的治疗。但是，这些其实都是没有用的，只是浪费医疗资源而已，让病人感觉有希望，而不是治愈死亡。死亡是治不好的。\n\n第三段\n\n①in 1950, the u.s. spent $12.7 billion on health care. ②in 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. ③anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. ④yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. ⑤some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so. ⑥former colorado governor richard lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential. 1950年，美国在医疗保健上花费了127亿美元。到2002年，医疗保健花费将达到1.54万亿美元。任何人都可以看出这种趋势是不可持续的。然而，似乎很少有人愿意试图扭转这一局面。一些学者认为，资源有限的政府应该停止为超过一定年龄的人（比如83岁左右）支付医疗费用。美国科罗拉多州前州长理查德•拉姆曾说过，年老体弱的人“有责任死去，让出位置位来”，让更年轻、更健康的人可以实现自己的健康潜力。\n\n①in 1950, the u.s. spent $12.7 billion on health care. 1950年，美国在医疗保健上花费了127亿美元。\n\nhealth care：医疗保健\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里的费用高，就是因为过多的治疗。但是，往往是没有用的。但是，因为，人们害怕死亡，所以，还是提供过多的治疗。\n\n②in 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. 到2002年，医疗保健花费将达到1.54万亿美元。\n\n③anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. 任何人都可以看出这种趋势是不可持续的。\n\nthis trend指前两句说的医疗保健花费越来越高这件事情\n\nsustain vt. 维持；保持；遭受；经受；支撑；证实。—— sustainable adj. 合理利用的；可持续的。—— unsustainable adj. 不能持续的；不能维持的。\n\n④yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. 然而，似乎很少有人愿意试图扭转这一局面。\n\nwilling adj. 愿意的；乐意的\n\nreverse vt. 颠倒；彻底改变；废除；撤销。\n\n⑤some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so. 一些学者认为，资源有限的政府应该停止为超过一定年龄的人（比如83岁左右）支付医疗费用。\n\nscholar n. 学者。—— scholarship n. 奖学金；学术；学术研究\n\nthat部分是宾语从句：a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so.\n\nwith部分是介词短语修饰government（政府）\n\nfinite adj. 有限的。—— infinite adj. 无限的\n\nresource n. 资源（这里指的是医疗资源）\n\nmedical care：医疗；医学治疗。\n\nthat部分是定语从句，修饰care：that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so.\n\nsay vt. 例如。\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，政府的医疗资源也是有限的，经不起想怎么治疗就怎么治疗这样的浪费，所以，如果某人超过某个年纪以后，政府就不再为其支付医疗费用了。就是说，让他死了算了。\n\n⑥former colorado governor richard lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential. 美国科罗拉多州前州长理查德•拉姆曾说过，年老体弱的人 “有责任死去，让出位置位来”，让更年轻、更健康的人可以实现自己的健康潜力。\n\ngovernor n. 州长\n\nquote as doing sth：引用；引述\n\nthat部分是宾语从句：the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential.\n\ninfirm adj. 病弱的；年老体弱的\n\nduty n. 责任\n\nget out the way：让开；让路；让出位置。\n\nso that后面是结果状语从句：younger, healthier people can realize their potential.\n\nrealize vt. 实现\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，那些老人，该死的就赶紧死，这样，好腾出地方来给年轻的人。\n\n总结：第三段是说，美国政府的医疗花费越来越高，这就让人们开始议论，是不是可以取消某些人的医疗支付，当他们超过一定年纪的时候。而且，有人认为，那些体弱的老人，有责任去死，这样可以腾出位置给年轻人。\n\n第四段\n\n①i would not go that far. ②energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and remain dazzlingly productive. ③at 78, viacom chairman sumner redstone jokingly claims to be 53. ④supreme court justice sandra day o’connor is in

现年78岁的维亚康姆集团董事长，萨姆纳·雷德斯通，开玩笑地说，自己才53岁。\n\nviacom，维亚康姆集团是美国第三大传媒公司，包括拥有39家地方电视台的电视集团、制作节目超过55000小时的派拉蒙电视集团、成立于1912年的派拉蒙电影公司（其库存影片超过2500部，包括、《阿甘正传》、《教父》、《碟中谍》、《泰坦尼克号》等经典影片）。\n\n萨姆纳·雷德斯通（sumner redstone，1923年—2020年8月11日 ），毕业于哈佛大学法学院，二战时成为一名兽医。美国传媒业巨无霸维亚集团老板。在他64岁的时候，控制大量资金恶意收购了维亚康姆（viacom）公司。2019年，福布斯全球亿万富豪榜排名第413位，财富值46亿美元。2020年8月11日，萨姆纳·雷德斯通在美国加州洛杉矶去世，享年97岁。\n\nchairman n.

老去\n\n总结：第四段是说，美国的老年人工作效率很高，所以，这就表明，人老了，不一定就是病魔缠身，很多随着年纪增加带来的问题，都是可以管理（控制）的。作者也希望自己年老了能够像那些高效率的老人一样。而不是，病魔缠身，整天和药罐子为伴，或者下半生都躺在医院的病床上。\n\n第五段\n\n①yet there are limits to what a society can spend in

然而，一个社会在医疗方面的投入是有限的。作为一名医生，我知道最昂贵和最激进的措施可能是无效和痛苦的。我还知道，日本和瑞典这两个在医疗保健上花费少得多的国家，却比我们活得更久、更健康。作为一个国家，我们可能过度资助了那些不可能治愈的要求，而在研究可以改善人们生活的更温和的疗法上投入不足。\n\n①yet there are limits to what a society can spend in

治疗；疗法。\n\nthat办法是定语从句，修饰therapy\n\n总结：第五段是说，一个国家在医疗上的投入是有限的，我们不能在那些不可能治愈的疾病上投入太多，而是应该投入那些可以改善人们生活的治疗方法上。也就是，不在医治像癌症晚期这样的病上面投入太多了，不要给他们提供太多的治疗，因为，治疗了也是没有用的，只是浪费资源而已。不要企图治愈死亡，死亡是不可避免的。\n\n 56. what is implied in the first sentence?\n\n 57. 文章第一句话暗示的是什么?\n\n解释：\n\na答案：说反了，他们无法面对死亡。\n\nb答案：不是这句话的意思。\n\nc答案：总结：第一段是说，过去一个世纪里，美国的医疗技术（水平）确实提高了很多，这个让人们过上了高质量的生活。但是，再伟大的医疗体系，也医不好死亡，就是该死的肯定要死，而不是，第一句话说的，死亡也可以选择。所以，第一句话表明美国人对自己的医疗技术的过度自信。但是，我们却不敢直接面对死亡。这会阻止人类变得伟大。所以，c正确。\n\nd答案：文章没有说他们感到骄傲，而且，也不是第一句话的意思。\n\na. americans are better prepared for death than other people美国人比其他人对死亡更有准备\n\nb. americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before美国人的生活质量比以往任何时候都高\n\nc. americans are over-confident of their

作者用癌症病人的例子，是为了表明\n\n解释：\n\na答案：总结：第二段是说，人们害怕死亡，而且，医疗费用也是由第三方支付的，所以，在看病的时候，往往都是要求医生，能用的治疗都用上，比如：癌症晚期的治疗，医生往往会对自己无力治愈这种疾病感到沮丧，而且，也害怕病人失去希望，所以，经常提供过多的治疗。但是，这些其实都是没有用的，只是浪费医疗资源而已，让病人感觉有希望，而不是治愈死亡。死亡是治不好的。而且，文章下文也说医疗花费猛增。所以，a正确。\n\nb答案：是文章的内容，但是，不是作者用这个例子的目的。\n\nc答案：文章没有提到some治疗方法的内容。\n\nd答案：无中生有。文章只说越来越多，没有说承担不起。\n\na. medical resources are often wasted医疗资源经常被浪费\n\nb. doctors are helpless against fatal diseases医生对致命的疾病无能为力\n\nc. some treatments are too aggressive有些治疗方法过于激进\n\nd. medical costs are becoming

consent保留的同意\n\nc. slight contempt轻微的蔑视\n\nd. enthusiastic support热情支持\n\n 59. in contrast to the u.s., japan and sweden are funding their medical care\n\n 60. 与美国相比，日本和瑞典医疗投资\n\n解释：\n\na答案：无中生有。\n\nb答案：无中生有。日本和瑞典投入少。\n\nc答案：无中生有。\n\nd答案：i also know that people in japan and sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have. as a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people’s lives. 即：日本和瑞典投入更少，但是，他们的人民活得更长、更健康。而美国则是把钱投到了那些不可能治愈的疾病上，而不是，投入到那个改善人们生活的治疗上。这表明美国的投入是不合理的。反之，日本和瑞典的投入更加合理。所以，d正确。\n\na. more flexibly更灵活\n\nb. more extravagantly更多奢侈\n\nc. more cautiously更为谨慎\n\nd. more reasonably更合理\n\n 60. the text intends to express the idea that\n\n 61. 文章意在表达这样的思想\n\n解释：\n\na答案：无中生有。这就是长生不老的药，文章没有说到。\n\nb答案：无中生有。\n\nc答案：本文从第一句话就开说关于死亡的问题，即：在美国死亡是可以选择的，但是，其实不是，是因为美国人害怕死亡。然后，因为，美国的医疗发达，所以，美国人在医治诸如癌症这样不可治愈的疾病上，投入巨大，往往为这样的病人提供过多的治疗。这样造成了大量不合理的医疗投入。文章从第二段开始就说，死亡是一件很正常的事情，那些昂贵的治疗都是没有用的，下文也说，该死的，就死吧，不要占着位置。而且，死亡是不可治愈的，很多随着年纪增大带来的问题都是可以管理的，在这些方面日本和瑞典做得就比美国好。所以，本文试图要传达的就是死亡是不可治愈的，死亡是必然的，任何治疗都是浪费。所以，c正确。\n\nd答案：是文章的内容，但是，不是本文的目的，本文的目的就是要借助不断的需求造成的投入的增加来说明死亡是不可避免的，因为，这些医疗投入都是浪费掉的，没有必要的。就是拿再多的钱去医治一个癌症晚期的人，都是医不好的，只是浪费资源。\n\na. medicine will further prolong people’s lives药物将进一步延长人们的生命\n\nb. life beyond a certain limit is not worth living超过一定限度的生命不值得活下去\n\nc. death should be accepted as a fact of

In the past year, our country has encountered many difficulties, and most of the people’s work and life have not been carried out smoothly. The COVID-19 is capricious, and the dynamic zero clearing policy is difficult. To sum up, the three-year fight against the epidemic has left us with too many bad memories, which has left us exhausted physically and mentally, the national finace unable to make ends meet, and grass-roots organizations have been working under high pressure and high load for a long time.

of wilderness tourism",charIndex:2}],headersStr:"T4P1 The Impact of Wilderness Tourism",content:"# T4P1 The Impact of Wilderness Tourism\n\nFragile regions and the reasons for the expansion of tourism there\n\nA The market for tourism in remote areas is booming as never before. Countries all across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth’s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.\n\nTourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley.\n\nSome of the disruptive effects of wilderness tourism\n\nB Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.\n\nIn Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season.

expansion of tourism there\n\na the market for tourism in remote areas is booming as never before. countries all across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. the attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. but that does not mean that there is no cost. as the 1992 united nations conference on environment and development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. the three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the earth’s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and arctic areas. an important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.\n\ntourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. and poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. for several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in nepal and bhutan. tourism is also a key element in the economies of arctic zones such as lapland and alaska and in desert areas such as ayers rock in australia and arizona’s monument valley.\n\nsome of the disruptive effects of wilderness tourism\n\nb once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. when hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. in some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. the result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.\n\nin arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. however, as some inhabitants become involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. all kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens if these new, external

By the way, I hope you will you're all conferteable comfortable - we have bought brought in extra seat seats so that no one has to stand, but this it doen't doesn't mean that the people at the back of the room may feel squetebe a bit squashed.\n     \n     >  * squashed: 在这里是作为形容词，表示被压扁或者挤压的状态。\n     > \n     > 例句：I feel so squashed in this crowded bus.(我在这辆拥挤的公交车上感到很不舒服。)\n\n 5.

One of the first question we're often ask asked is how old you need to be a to volunteer.\n\n 7.  Will, you can be as young as 16 or you can be 16 60 or over, it's it all depend depends on what type of voluntary work you want to do.\n\n 8.

Well, thats there's plante at plenty of that and is it's all face-to-face.\n     \n     >  * plenty: a large amount; as much or as many as you need\n\n 11.

Now I will would ask you to consider a couple of important issue issues before you decide to apply to for voluntary work.\n\n 14.

But it's curital critical that you have enough hours in a the day for whatever role we agree is suitful to suitable for you. if being a volunteer to become becomes stressful that is better not to be then it's best not to doit at all.\n     \n     > role在这里是名词，指的是某个具体的职责或者角色\n     > \n     > we agree在这里是我们认为的意思\n\n 16. You may think that your income is important but we don't askedask about that.\n\n 17. It's up to you to decide if you can work without any earning money.\n\n 18.

by Americans on mobile and landline phone services from 2001 to 2010.\n\n折线图比较了2001年至2010年间美国人在移动电话和固定电话服务上的平均年度支出。\n\nIt is clear that spending on landline phones fell steadily over the 10-year period, while mobile phone expenditure rose quickly. The year 2006 marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.\n\n很明显，在这10年间，固定电话的支出稳步下降，而移动电话的支出迅速增加。2006年是移动服务支出超过住宅电话服务支出的时间点。\n\nIn 2001, US consumers spent an average of nearly $700 on residential phone services, compared to only around $200 on cell phone services. Over the following five years, average yearly spending on landlines dropped by nearly $200. By contrast, expenditure on mobiles rose by approximately $300.\n\n2001年，美国消费者在住宅电话服务上的平均支出接近700美元，而在手机服务上的支出仅约200美元。在接下来的五年里，固定电话的平均年度支出减少了近200美元。相比之下，移动电话的支出增加了约300美元。\n\nIn the year 2006, the average American paid out the same amount of money on both types of phone service, spending just over $500 on each. By 2010, expenditure on mobile phones had reached around $750, while the figure for spending on residential services had fallen to just over half this amount.\n\n2006年，美国人在这两种电话服务上的支出金额相同，每种支出刚超过500美元。到2010年，手机支出达到约750美元，而住宅服务的支出则降至此数额的一半多一点。\n\n\n# Simon S102\n\nThe diagram illustrates the various stages in the life of a honey bee. We can see that the complete life cycle lasts between 34 and 36 days. It is also noticeable that there are five main stages in the development of the honey bee, from egg to mature adult insect.\n\n图表展示了蜜蜂生命周期的各个阶段。可以看出，蜜蜂的完整生命周期持续34至36天。同样值得注意的是，蜜蜂的发展从卵到成熟成虫共有五个主要阶段。\n\nThe life cycle of the honey bee begins when the female adult lays an egg; the female typically lays one or two eggs every 3 days. Between 9 and 10 days later, each egg hatches and the immature insect, or nymph, appears.\n\n蜜蜂的生命周期开始于成年雌蜂产卵；雌蜂通常每3天产一到两个卵。在9到10天后，每个卵孵化，出现幼虫（若虫）。\n\nDuring the third stage of the life cycle, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin three times. This moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days later, and again another 9 days later. After a total of 30 to 31 days from the start of the cycle, the young adult honey bee emerges from its final moulting stage, and in the space of only 4 days it reaches full maturity.\n\n在生命周期的第三阶段，若虫体积增大并蜕皮三次。第一次蜕皮发生在卵孵化后5天，然后是7天后，再次是再过9天。从周期开始后总共30到31天，年轻的成年蜜蜂从最后一次蜕皮阶段出现，在短短4天内达到完全成熟。\n\n\n# Simon S103\n\nThe chart compares average figures for temperature and precipitation over the course of a calendar year in Kolkata. It is noticeable that monthly figures for precipitation in Kolkata vary considerably, whereas monthly temperatures remain relatively stable. Rainfall is highest from July to August, while temperatures are highest in April and May.\n\n该图表比较了加尔各答一年中的平均温度和降水量。值得注意的是，加尔各答的月降水量变化较大，而月温度相对稳定。降雨量在7月到8月最高，而温度在4月和5月最高。\n\nBetween the months of January and May, average temperatures in Kolkata rise from their lowest point at around 20°C to a peak of just over 30°C. Average rainfall in the city also rises over the same period, from approximately 20mm of rain in January to 100mm in May.\n\n在1月至5月期间，加尔各答的平均温度从最低点约20°C上升到刚刚超过30°C的高点。同期，城市的平均降雨量也从1月的约20毫米上升到5月的100毫米。\n\nWhile temperatures stay roughly the same for the next four months, the amount of rainfall more than doubles between May and June. Figures for precipitation remain above 250mm from June to September, peaking at around 330mm in July. The final three months of the year see a dramatic fall in precipitation, to a low of about 10mm in December, and a steady drop in temperatures back to the January average.\n\n尽管接下来四个月的温度大致相同，但5月到6月间的降雨量增加了一倍以上。6月至9月的降水量保持在250毫米以上，7月达到约330毫米的高峰。年底最后三个月降水量急剧下降，到12月降至约10毫米，并且温度稳步回落至1月的平均水平。\n\n\n# Simon S104\n\nThe bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of why they are studying and whether they are supported by an employer.\n\n条形图比较了不同年龄的学生在为什么学习以及是否得到雇主支持方面的差异。\n\nIt is clear that the proportion of students who study for career purposes is far higher among the younger age groups, while the oldest students are more likely to study for interest. Employer support is more commonly given to younger students.\n\n显然，为职业目的学习的学生比例在年轻年龄组中远高于其他组，而最年长的学生更可能因兴趣而学习。雇主的支持更多地给予年轻学生。\n\nAround 80% of students aged under 26 study to further their careers, whereas only 10% study purely out of interest. The gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those in their forties are the same, at about 40%. Students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%) rather than for professional reasons (less than 20%).\n\n大约80%的26岁以下学生为了进一步发展其职业而学习，而只有10%的学生纯粹出于兴趣而学习。这两个比例之间的差距随着学生年龄的增长而缩小，四十多岁的学生比例相同，约为40%。49岁以上的学生绝大多数是因兴趣（70%）而非职业原因（少于20%）而学习。\n\nJust over 60% of students aged under 26 are supported by their employers. By contrast, the 30-39 age group is the most self-sufficient, with only 30% being given time off and help with fees. The figures rise slightly for students in their forties and for those aged 50 or more.\n\n超过60%的26岁以下学生得到了雇主的支持。相比之下，30-39岁的年龄组最为自给自足，只有30%的人获得了休假和费用帮助。四十多岁的学生和50岁以上的学生的数字略有上升。\n\n\n# Simon S105\n\nThe bar chart compares the number of incidents and injuries for every 100 million passenger miles traveled on five different types of public transport in 2002.\n\n条形图比较了2002年五种不同公共交通方式每一亿乘客英里旅行中发生的事故和伤害数量。\n\nIt is clear that the most incidents and injuries took place on demand-response vehicles. By contrast, commuter rail services recorded by far the lowest figures.\n\n很明显，需求响应型车辆发生了最多的事故和伤害。相比之下，通勤铁路服务的数字远远最低。\n\nA total of 225 incidents and 173 injuries, per 100 million passenger miles traveled, took place on demand-response transport services. These figures were nearly three times as high as those for the second highest category, bus services. There were 76 incidents and 66 people were injured on buses.\n\n在需求响应型交通服务上，每一亿乘客英里旅行中共发生了225起事故和173起伤害。这些数字几乎是第二高类别，即公交服务数字的三倍。公交车上发生了76起事故，66人受伤。\n\nRail services experienced fewer problems. The number of incidents on light rail trains equaled the figure recorded for buses, but there were significantly fewer injuries, at only 39. Heavy rail services saw lower numbers of such events than light rail services, but commuter rail passengers were even less likely to experience problems. In fact, only 20 incidents and 17 injuries occurred on commuter trains.\n\n铁路服务遇到的问题较少。轻轨列车的事故数量与公交车记录的数字相等，但受伤人数显著较少，仅为39人。重轨服务的此类事件数量低于轻轨服务，但通勤铁路乘客遇到问题的可能性更小。实际上，通勤列车仅发生了20起事故和17起伤害。\n\n\n# Simon S106\n\nThe line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65 or more in three countries over a period of 100 years. It is clear that the proportion of elderly people increases in each country between 1940 and 2040. Japan is expected to see the most dramatic changes in its elderly population.\n\n折线图比较了三个国家中65岁及以上人口的百分比，时间跨度为100年。很明显，在1940年到2040年间，每个国家的老年人口比例都在增加。预计日本在老年人口中将看到最剧烈的变化。\n\nIn 1940, around 9% of Americans were aged 65 or over, compared to about 7% of Swedish people and 5% of Japanese people. The proportions of elderly people in the USA and Sweden rose gradually over the next 50 years, reaching just under 15% in 1990. By contrast, the figures for Japan remained below 5% until the early 2000s.\n\n1940年，大约9%的美国人年龄在65岁以上，相比之下，约7%的瑞典人和5%的日本人。在接下来的50年里，美国和瑞典的老年人口比例逐渐上升，到1990年接近15%。相比之下，日本的数据直到21世纪初仍然低于5%。\n\nLooking into the future, a sudden increase in the percentage of elderly people is predicted for Japan, with a jump of over 15% in just 10 years from 2030 to 2040. By 2040, it is thought that around 27% of the Japanese population will be 65 years old or more, while the figures for Sweden and the USA will be slightly lower, at about 25% and 23% respectively.\n\n展望未来，预计日本的老年人口比例将突然增加，在2030年到2040年的10年间增加超过15%。预计到2040年，约27%的日本人将年满65岁或以上，而瑞典和美国的数据将略低，分别约为25%和23%。\n\n\n# Simon S107\n\nThe table shows percentages of consumer expenditure for three categories of products and services in five countries in 2002.\n\n该表显示了2002年五个国家在三类产品和服务上的消费支出百分比。\n\nIt is clear that the largest proportion of consumer spending in each country went on food, drinks, and tobacco. On the other hand, the leisure/education category has the lowest percentages in the table. Out of the five countries, consumer spending on food, drinks, and tobacco was noticeably higher in Turkey, at 32.14%, and Ireland, at nearly 29%. The proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in Turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in Italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.\n\n很明显，每个国家的消费支出中食品、饮料和烟草的比例最大。另一方面，休闲/教育类别在表中的百分比最低。在这五个国家中，土耳其和爱尔兰在食品、饮料和烟草上的消费支出明显较高，分别为32.14%和近29%。在休闲和教育方面的支出比例，土耳其也是最高的，为4.35%，而意大利在服装和鞋类的支出上明显高于其他国家，为9%。\n\nIt can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively. Spain had slightly higher figures for these categories, but the lowest figure for leisure/education, at only 1.98%.\n\n可以看出，瑞典在食品/饮料/烟草和服装/鞋类的国民消费支出百分比最低，分别为近16%和略高于5%。西班牙在这些类别的数字略高，但在休闲/教育方面的数字最低，仅为1.98%。\n\n\n# Simon S108\n\nThe charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.\n\n\n# Simon S109\n\nThe bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over aperiod of 13 years from 1989. We can see that house prices fell overall between 1990 and 1995, but most of the cities saw rising prices between 1996 and 2002. London experienced by far the greatest changes in house prices over the 13-year period.\n\nOver the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in Tokyo and London dropped by around 7%, while New York house prices went down by 5%. By contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both Madrid and Frankfurt.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, London house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. Homebuyers in New York also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in Tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. The cost of an average home in Madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in Frankfurt remained stable.\n\n\n# Simon S110\n\nIt is noticeable that levels of poverty were higher for single people than for couples, and people with children were more likely to be poor than those without. Poverty rates were considerably lower among elderly people.\n\nOverall, 11% of Australians, or 1,837,000 people, were living in poverty in 1999. Aged people were the least likely to be poor, with poverty levels of 6% and 4% for single aged people and aged couples respectively.\n\nJust over one fifth of single parents were living in poverty, whereas only 12% of parents living with a partner were classed as poor. The same pattern can be seen for people with no children: while 19% of single people in this group were living below the poverty line, the figure for couples was much lower, at only 7%.\n\n\n# Simon S111\n\nThe main difference between the two sites is that S1 is outside the town, whereas S2 is in the town centre. The sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns.\n\nLooking at the information in more detail, S1 is in the countryside to the northwest of Garlsdon, but it is close to the residential area of the town. S2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.\n\nThere are main roads from Hindon, Bransdon and Cransdon to Garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to S2 by car. By contrast, S1 lies on the main road to Hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from Bransdon and Cransdon. Both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through Garlsdon from Hindon to Cransdon.\n\n\n# Simon S112\n\nThe bar chart compares consumer spending on six different items in Germany, Italy, France and Britain.\n\nIt is clear that British people spent significantly more money than people in the other three countries on all six goods. Of the six items, consumers spent the most money on photographic film.\n\nPeople in Britain spent just over £170,000 on photographic film, which is the highest figure shown on the chart. By contrast, Germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under £150,000) for each of the six products.\n\nThe figures for spending on toys were the same in both France and Italy, at nearly £160,000. However, while French people spent more than Italians on photographic film and CDs, Italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. The amount spent by French people on tennis racquets, around £145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.\n\n\n# Simon S113\n\nThe diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate. The most noticeable difference between houses designed for cool and warm climates is in the shape of the roof. The designs also differ with regard to the windows and the use of insulation.\n\nWe can see that the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. By contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and roof overhangs to shade the windows. Insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep the heat out in warm climates.\n\nFinally, the cool climate house has one window which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on two sides which are shaded from the sun. By opening the two windows at night, the house designed for warm climates can be ventilated.\n\n\n# Simon S114\n\nThe picture illustrates the way in which water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as the water cycle.\n\nThree main stages are shown on the diagram. Ocean water evaporates, falls as rain, and eventually runs back into the oceans again.\n\nBeginning at the evaporation stage, we can see that 80% of water vapour in the air comes from the oceans. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate, and water vapour condenses to form clouds. At the second stage, labelled ‘precipitation’ on the diagram, water falls as rain or snow.\n\nAt the third stage in the cycle, rainwater may take various paths. Some of it may fall into lakes or return to the oceans via ‘surface runoff’. Otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth. Salt water intrusion is shown to take place just before groundwater passes into the oceans to complete the cycle.\n\n\n# Simon S115\n\nThe first picture shows the layout of an art gallery, and the second shows some proposed changes to the gallery space.\n\nIt is clear that significant changes will be made in terms of the use of floor space in the gallery. There will be a completely new entrance and more space for exhibitions.\n\nAt present, visitors enter the gallery through doors which lead into a lobby. However, the plan is to move the entrance to the Parkinson Court side of the building, and visitors will walk straight into the exhibition area. In place of the lobby and office areas, which are shown on the existing plan, the new gallery plan shows an education area and a small storage area.\n\nThe permanent exhibition space in the redeveloped gallery will be about twice as large as it is now because it will occupy the area that is now used for temporary exhibitions. There will also be a new room for special exhibitions. This room is shown in red on the existing plan and is not currently part of the gallery.\n\n\n# Simon S116\n\nThe table compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year. It is clear that the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems.\n\nThe London underground is the oldest system, having opened in 1863. It is also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. The second largest system, in Paris, is only about half the size of the London underground, with 199 kilometres of route. However, it serves more people per year. While only third in terms of size, the Tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year.\n\nOf the three newer networks, the Washington DC underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the Kyoto and Los Angeles systems. The Los Angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the Kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year.\n\n\n# Simon S117\n\nThe pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.\n\nTotal electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both Australia and France. While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\nCoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country’s electricity.\n\nAustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source inFrance, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.\n\n\n# Simon S118\n\nThe chart gives information about UK immigration, emigration and net migration between 1999 and 2008. Both immigration and emigration rates rose over the period shown, but the figures for immigration were significantly higher. Net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007.\n\nIn 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the UK, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. The figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. From 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. Net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.\n\nAfter 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. Emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. As a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.\n\n\n# Simon S119\n\nIt is clear from the charts that the figures for developed countries are much higher than those for developing nations. Also, the charts show an overall increase in participation in education and science from 1980 to 1990.\n\nPeople in developing nations attended school for an average of around 3 years, with only a slight increase in years of schooling from 1980 to 1990. On the other hand, the figure for industrialised countries rose from nearly 9 years of schooling in 1980 to nearly 11 years in 1990.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, the number of scientists and technicians in industrialised countries almost doubled to about 70 per 1000 people. Spending on research and development also saw rapid growth in these countries, reaching 350 billion in 1990. By contrast, the number of science workers in developing countries remained below 20 per 1000 people, and research spending fell from about 50 billion to only 25 billion.\n\n\n# Simon S120\n\nThe figure illustrates the process used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to forecast the weather.\n\nThere are four stages in the process, beginning with the collection of information about the weather. This information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public.\n\nLooking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.\n\n\n# Simon S121\n\nThe line graph compares the percentage of people in three countries who used the Internet between 1999 and 2009.\n\nIt is clear that the proportion of the population who used the Internet increased in each country over the period shown. Overall, a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the Internet in comparison with Mexicans, and Canada experienced the fastest growth in Internet usage.\n\nIn 1999, the proportion of people using the Internet in the USA was about 20%. The figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. In 2005, Internet usage in both the USA and Canada rose to around 70% of the population, while the figure for Mexico reached just over 25%.\n\nBy 2009, the percentage of Internet users was highest in Canada. Almost 100% of Canadians used the Internet, compared to about 80% of Americans and only 40% of Mexicans.\n\n\n# Simon S122\n\nThe map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood between 1868 and 1994. It is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",normalizedContent:"# simon s101\n\nthe line graph compares average yearly spending by americans on mobile and landline phone services from 2001 to

marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.\n\n很明显，在这10年间，固定电话的支出稳步下降，而移动电话的支出迅速增加。2006年是移动服务支出超过住宅电话服务支出的时间点。\n\nin 2001, us consumers spent an average of nearly $700 on residential phone services, compared to only around $200 on cell phone services. over the following five years, average yearly spending on landlines dropped by nearly $200. by contrast, expenditure on mobiles rose by approximately $300.\n\n2001年，美国消费者在住宅电话服务上的平均支出接近700美元，而在手机服务上的支出仅约200美元。在接下来的五年里，固定电话的平均年度支出减少了近200美元。相比之下，移动电话的支出增加了约300美元。\n\nin the year 2006, the average american paid out the same amount of money on both types of phone service, spending just over $500 on each. by 2010, expenditure on mobile phones had reached around $750, while the figure for spending on residential services had fallen to just over half this amount.\n\n2006年，美国人在这两种电话服务上的支出金额相同，每种支出刚超过500美元。到2010年，手机支出达到约750美元，而住宅服务的支出则降至此数额的一半多一点。\n\n\n# simon s102\n\nthe diagram

development of the honey bee, from egg to mature adult insect.\n\n图表展示了蜜蜂生命周期的各个阶段。可以看出，蜜蜂的完整生命周期持续34至36天。同样值得注意的是，蜜蜂的发展从卵到成熟成虫共有五个主要阶段。\n\nthe life cycle of the honey bee begins when the female adult lays an egg; the female typically lays one or two eggs every 3 days. between 9 and 10 days later, each egg hatches and the immature insect, or nymph, appears.\n\n蜜蜂的生命周期开始于成年雌蜂产卵；雌蜂通常每3天产一到两个卵。在9到10天后，每个卵孵化，出现幼虫（若虫）。\n\nduring the third stage of the life cycle, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin three times. this moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days later, and again another 9 days later. after a total of 30 to 31 days from the start of the cycle, the young adult honey bee emerges from its final moulting stage, and in the space of only 4 days it reaches full maturity.\n\n在生命周期的第三阶段，若虫体积增大并蜕皮三次。第一次蜕皮发生在卵孵化后5天，然后是7天后，再次是再过9天。从周期开始后总共30到31天，年轻的成年蜜蜂从最后一次蜕皮阶段出现，在短短4天内达到完全成熟。\n\n\n# simon s103\n\nthe chart

higher among the younger age groups, while the oldest students are more likely to study for interest. employer support is more commonly given to younger students.\n\n显然，为职业目的学习的学生比例在年轻年龄组中远高于其他组，而最年长的学生更可能因兴趣而学习。雇主的支持更多地给予年轻学生。\n\naround 80% of students aged under 26 study to further their careers, whereas only 10% study purely out of interest. the gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those in their forties are the same, at about 40%. students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%) rather than for professional reasons (less than 20%).\n\n大约80%的26岁以下学生为了进一步发展其职业而学习，而只有10%的学生纯粹出于兴趣而学习。这两个比例之间的差距随着学生年龄的增长而缩小，四十多岁的学生比例相同，约为40%。49岁以上的学生绝大多数是因兴趣（70%）而非职业原因（少于20%）而学习。\n\njust over 60% of students aged under 26 are supported by their employers. by contrast, the 30-39 age group is the most self-sufficient, with only 30% being given time off and help with fees. the figures rise slightly for students in their forties and for those aged 50 or more.\n\n超过60%的26岁以下学生得到了雇主的支持。相比之下，30-39岁的年龄组最为自给自足，只有30%的人获得了休假和费用帮助。四十多岁的学生和50岁以上的学生的数字略有上升。\n\n\n# simon s105\n\nthe bar chart

figures were nearly three times as high as those for the second highest category, bus services. there were 76 incidents and 66 people were injured on buses.\n\n在需求响应型交通服务上，每一亿乘客英里旅行中共发生了225起事故和173起伤害。这些数字几乎是第二高类别，即公交服务数字的三倍。公交车上发生了76起事故，66人受伤。\n\nrail services experienced fewer problems. the number of incidents on light rail trains equaled the figure recorded for buses, but there were significantly fewer injuries, at only 39. heavy rail services saw lower numbers of such events than light rail services, but commuter rail passengers were even less likely to experience problems. in fact, only 20 incidents and 17 injuries occurred on commuter trains.\n\n铁路服务遇到的问题较少。轻轨列车的事故数量与公交车记录的数字相等，但受伤人数显著较少，仅为39人。重轨服务的此类事件数量低于轻轨服务，但通勤铁路乘客遇到问题的可能性更小。实际上，通勤列车仅发生了20起事故和17起伤害。\n\n\n# simon s106\n\nthe line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65

categories of products and services in five countries in 2002.\n\n该表显示了2002年五个国家在三类产品和服务上的消费支出百分比。\n\nit is clear that the largest proportion of consumer spending in each country went on food, drinks, and tobacco. on the other hand, the leisure/education category has the lowest percentages in the table. out of the five countries, consumer spending on food, drinks, and tobacco was noticeably higher in turkey, at 32.14%, and ireland, at nearly 29%. the proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.\n\n很明显，每个国家的消费支出中食品、饮料和烟草的比例最大。另一方面，休闲/教育类别在表中的百分比最低。在这五个国家中，土耳其和爱尔兰在食品、饮料和烟草上的消费支出明显较高，分别为32.14%和近29%。在休闲和教育方面的支出比例，土耳其也是最高的，为4.35%，而意大利在服装和鞋类的支出上明显高于其他国家，为9%。\n\nit can be seen that sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively. spain had slightly higher figures for these categories, but the lowest figure for leisure/education, at only 1.98%.\n\n可以看出，瑞典在食品/饮料/烟草和服装/鞋类的国民消费支出百分比最低，分别为近16%和略高于5%。西班牙在这些类别的数字略高，但在休闲/教育方面的数字最低，仅为1.98%。\n\n\n# simon s108\n\nthe charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in brazil and the democratic republic of congo.\n\nit is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. we can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in brazil than in the congo.\n\nin 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. the figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. by 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³.\n\nin the year 2000, the populations of brazil and the congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. water consumption per person in brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.\n\n\n# simon s109\n\nthe bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over aperiod of 13

house prices over the 13-year period.\n\nover the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in tokyo and london dropped by around 7%, while new york house prices went down by 5%. by contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both madrid and frankfurt.\n\nbetween 1996 and 2002, london house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. homebuyers in new york also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. the cost of an average home in madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in frankfurt remained stable.\n\n\n# simon s110\n\nit is noticeable that levels of poverty were higher for single people than for couples, and people with children were more likely to be poor than those without. poverty rates were considerably lower among elderly people.\n\noverall, 11% of australians, or 1,837,000 people, were living in poverty in 1999. aged people were the least likely to be poor, with poverty levels of 6% and 4% for single aged people and aged couples respectively.\n\njust over one fifth of single parents were living in poverty, whereas only 12% of parents living with a partner were classed as poor. the same pattern can be seen for people with no children: while 19% of single people in this group were living below the poverty line, the figure for couples was much lower, at only 7%.\n\n\n# simon s111\n\nthe main difference between the two sites is that s1 is outside the town, whereas s2 is in the town centre. the sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns.\n\nlooking at the information in more detail, s1 is in the countryside to the northwest of garlsdon, but it is close to the residential area of the town. s2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.\n\nthere are main roads from hindon, bransdon and cransdon to garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to s2 by car. by contrast, s1 lies on the main road to hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from bransdon and cransdon. both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through garlsdon from hindon to cransdon.\n\n\n# simon s112\n\nthe bar chart compares consumer spending on six different items in germany, italy, france and britain.\n\nit is clear that british people spent significantly more money than people in the other three countries on all six goods. of the six items, consumers spent the most money on photographic film.\n\npeople in britain spent just over £170,000 on photographic film, which is the highest figure shown on the chart. by contrast, germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under £150,000) for each of the six products.\n\nthe figures for spending on toys were the same in both france and italy, at nearly £160,000. however, while french people spent more than italians on photographic film and cds, italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. the amount spent by french people on tennis racquets, around £145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.\n\n\n# simon s113\n\nthe diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate. the most noticeable difference between houses designed for cool and warm climates is in the shape of the roof. the designs also differ with regard to the windows and the use of insulation.\n\nwe can see that the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. by contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and roof overhangs to shade the windows. insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep the heat out in warm climates.\n\nfinally, the cool climate house has one window which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on two sides which are shaded from the sun. by opening the two windows at night, the house designed for warm climates can be ventilated.\n\n\n# simon s114\n\nthe picture illustrates the way in which water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as the water cycle.\n\nthree main stages are shown on the diagram. ocean water evaporates, falls as rain, and eventually runs back into the oceans again.\n\nbeginning at the evaporation stage, we can see that 80% of water vapour in the air comes from the oceans. heat from the sun causes water to evaporate, and water vapour condenses to form clouds. at the second stage, labelled ‘precipitation’ on the diagram, water falls as rain or snow.\n\nat the third stage in the cycle, rainwater may take various paths. some of it may fall into lakes or return to the oceans via ‘surface runoff’. otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth. salt water intrusion is shown to take place just before groundwater passes into the oceans to complete the cycle.\n\n\n# simon s115\n\nthe first picture shows the layout of an art gallery, and the second shows some proposed changes to the gallery space.\n\nit is clear that significant changes will be made in terms of the use of floor space in the gallery. there will be a completely new entrance and more space for exhibitions.\n\nat present, visitors enter the gallery through doors which lead into a lobby. however, the plan is to move the entrance to the parkinson court side of the building, and visitors will walk straight into the exhibition area. in place of the lobby and office areas, which are shown on the existing plan, the new gallery plan shows an education area and a small storage area.\n\nthe permanent exhibition space in the redeveloped gallery will be about twice as large as it is now because it will occupy the area that is now used for temporary exhibitions. there will also be a new room for special exhibitions. this room is shown in red on the existing plan and is not currently part of the gallery.\n\n\n# simon s116\n\nthe table compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year. it is clear that the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems.\n\nthe london underground is the oldest system, having opened in 1863. it is also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. the second largest system, in paris, is only about half the size of the london underground, with 199 kilometres of route. however, it serves more people per year. while only third in terms of size, the tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year.\n\nof the three newer networks, the washington dc underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the kyoto and los angeles systems. the los angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year.\n\n\n# simon s117\n\nthe pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.\n\ntotal electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both australia and france. while the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\ncoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. by contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in france in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country’s electricity.\n\naustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in france. oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source infrance, but its use declined in australia. both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.\n\n\n# simon s118\n\nthe chart gives information about uk immigration, emigration and net migration between 1999 and 2008. both immigration and emigration rates rose over the period shown, but the figures for immigration were significantly higher. net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007.\n\nin 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the uk, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. the figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. from 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.\n\nafter 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. as a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.\n\n\n# simon s119\n\nit is clear from the charts that the figures for developed countries are much higher than those for developing nations. also, the charts show an overall increase in participation in education and science from 1980 to 1990.\n\npeople in developing nations attended school for an average of around 3 years, with only a slight increase in years of schooling from 1980 to 1990. on the other hand, the figure for industrialised countries rose from nearly 9 years of schooling in 1980 to nearly 11 years in 1990.\n\nfrom 1980 to 1990, the number of scientists and technicians in industrialised countries almost doubled to about 70 per 1000 people. spending on research and development also saw rapid growth in these countries, reaching 350 billion in 1990. by contrast, the number of science workers in developing countries remained below 20 per 1000 people, and research spending fell from about 50 billion to only 25 billion.\n\n\n# simon s120\n\nthe figure

This migration has led to a significant depopulation of the rural areas, causing many negative feelings about urbanization. However, in my opinion, this is a positive phenomenon.\n\nIt is true that the depopulation in the countryside causecauses many social problemproblems, such as a lack of laber and badpoor infustructure.

Becaue I believe that other factors play an equally significant role and should not be overlooked. Focusing too heavily on financial gain as a motivation for employment can leave a negative impression on potential employers, potentially hindering one's chances of securing higher-paying opportunities.\n\n首先来说，我所说的金钱不是最重要的不等于金钱不重要，相反钱的重要程度是远超其他因素的，因为在当今的市场经济背景下，钱是维持人日常生活的必需品。例如，我们都需要钱来支付住房、食物、信用卡账单、医疗和教育。一份能赚取覆盖这些需求，并拥有合理生活质量的薪水是必然是要优先考虑的，同时工资的高与低很大程度上代表了公司的好与坏，好的公司通常更愿意给员工更好的待遇和福利，这使得工资成为了一个很好的衡量公司好坏的标准。如果人们基于享受或其他非财务因素选择工作，他们可能会发现很难维持生活。例如，艺术家和音乐家以选择自己热爱的职业道路而闻名，但这并不总是能为他们提供足够的资金来舒适地生活和抚养家庭。\n\nFirst and foremost, while I assert that money is not the most crucial factor, it does not mean that it is unimportant. On the contrary, in the context of today's economic environment, money significantly surpasses other factors because it is essential for maintaining daily life. For instance, we all need money to pay for housing, food, credit card bills, medical care, and education. A salary that covers these needs and provides a reasonable quality of life must naturally be a priority. Furthermore, the level of wages often reflects the quality of a company; better companies usually offer better compensation and benefits to their employees, making salary a good measure of a company’s standing. However, if individuals choose jobs based on passion or other non-financial factors alone, they may find it challenging to sustain a living. For example, artists and musicians are known for pursuing careers driven by passion, yet this does not always provide them with sufficient funds to live comfortably or support a family.\n\n然而，我认为还有很多其他因素和收入同样重要。首先，个人关系和工作场所的氛围在选择工作时极为重要。例如，拥有一位好的经理或友好的同事，可以极大地影响工人的幸福感和总体生活质量。其次，许多人的工作满意感来自于他们的职业成就、他们学到的技能以及他们工作中获得的社会声望，赚到了钱只是其中的一部分。最后，一些人选择职业是因为他们想帮助他人并为社会做出积极贡献。\n\nHowever, I believe there are many other factors that are equally important as income. Firstly, personal relationships and the workplace atmosphere are crucial when choosing a job. For example, having a good manager or friendly colleagues can greatly enhance one's sense of well-being and overall quality of life. Secondly, many people derive job satisfaction from their professional achievements, the skills they acquire, and the social prestige they gain from their work, where earning money is just one part of the equation. Lastly, some individuals choose their careers because they wish to help others and make a positive contribution to society.\n\n总之，尽管薪水确实影响人们的职业选择，但我不认为金钱超过所有其他择业因素。\n\nIn conclusion, although salary

发展阶段二：教育学作为独立学科出现\n\n出现的本质原因是1840年人类迈入工业化社会之后，生产力大幅度发展。无论是科技、文化、政治、经济都出现大幅进步，这都为教育学的出现提供了物质基础。\n\n原因：\n\n 1. 生产力提升，实践的知识需求提高\n 2. 近代科学的高速发展，远超古代总和\n 3. 跟随生产力发展而出现的大量著名教育人士\n 4. 知识开始逐渐沉淀\n\n标志：\n\n 1. 成为了专门的学术领域\n 2. 独有的概念出现了\n 3. 有了更为科学的研究方法\n 4. 开始出现相关著作（相较于以前片面的内容，更为完整，系统化）\n 5. 各种研究机构开始出现\n\n详解：教育学（走向独立学科）的过程\n\n年份      代表人物    特征点\n1632年   夸美纽斯    班级授课的形式出现了（延续至今）\n1693年   洛克

——》 证明\n\n> 与赫尔巴特有对立性，强调实验，反对思辨（赫尔巴特强调思辨）\n\n优点：严谨性高，依据性强\n\n缺点：有唯科学主义的嫌疑，过度依赖实验\n\n# 2. 文化教育学\n\n是与实验教育学互相对立的教育学派，秉持人是一种文化存在。\n\n教育方针是：将人类的文化内化给学生\n\n精神或文化科学方法、思辨、陶冶情操、唤醒\n\n# 3. 实用主义教育学\n\n这个流派是杜威的，就是胡适那叼毛天天追捧的老师。但杜威本人确实在教育上造诣很深。\n\n疑问：为什么是对赫尔巴特的批判呢？\n\n# 4. 马克思主义教育学\n\n最早将其付诸实践的是毛子，是对马克思主义教育学部分的第一次实践\n\n教育是生产力再生产的过程\n\n是培养人全面发展的手段\n\n教育必须与生产劳动相结合\n\n> 番外问题：为什么容易机械化，教条话，甚至政治化？\n\n优点：充分应用马克思主义这一全新的唯物主义分析方法，具有相当的科学性\n\n缺点：实践中因为种种原因，很容易出现机械化、教条话、政治化的问题\n\n# 5. 制度教育学\n\n很多强调对于制度的批判，要分析制度，让制度为教育所用\n\n优点：重视制度\n\n缺点：过度依赖精神分析？\n\n# 6. 批判教育学\n\n1970年代\n\n注重敏感性，要对周边事物保持敏感性\n\n继承了马克思的批判方法\n\n批判了资本主义的教育\n\n但是批判的太深刻，却没有啥有用的改进方法\n\n\n# 2.2 回到当代教育学：进入理论深化阶段\n\n# 1. 新课改：用到的教育目标分类学\n\n将教育目标氛围认知、情感、动作，对教育评价有重大意义\n\n# 2. 知识结构学\n\n主张要让学生了解知识结构，结构很重要，用结构引导学生自己理解领悟\n\n# 3. 苏联教育思想\n\n实验，与教学最优化巴拉巴拉\n\n# 4. 我国的教育学思想\n\n中国的教育发展其实非常有历史，有很多研究\n\n研究的很广泛\n\n这个时期的教育学研究出现了很多新特征：\n\n * 问题领域光速扩大\n * 研究基础研究模式多样化\n * 细化特别多，很多都可以研究\n * 教育学研究与实践改革的关系更密切了\n * 教育学加强了对自身的反思，出现元原理（元化概念？）\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第二部分： 中国教育史\n\n教育史的学习的重要性仅次于教育学，要结合历史学习教育史\n\n中国古代教育史发展轨迹：\n\n儒学 --》经学（董仲舒） --》

研究任务\n\n揭示教育规律，探究教育的价值观念和教育的艺术。\n\n\n# 1.1 发展阶段一：教育学的萌芽阶段\n\n中国：《学记》竹简上的，只有1200字，但非常深刻的讨论了教育和政治的关系（是世界想最早的相关著作\n\n西方：昆体良 —— 培养演说家\n\n> 但是在古代社会（原始 ——》奴隶社会 ——》封建社会）都是非独立学科，只是有了学科萌芽。\n\n\n# 1.2 发展阶段二：教育学作为独立学科出现\n\n出现的本质原因是1840年人类迈入工业化社会之后，生产力大幅度发展。无论是科技、文化、政治、经济都出现大幅进步，这都为教育学的出现提供了物质基础。\n\n原因：\n\n 1. 生产力提升，实践的知识需求提高\n 2. 近代科学的高速发展，远超古代总和\n 3. 跟随生产力发展而出现的大量著名教育人士\n 4. 知识开始逐渐沉淀\n\n标志：\n\n 1. 成为了专门的学术领域\n 2. 独有的概念出现了\n 3. 有了更为科学的研究方法\n 4. 开始出现相关著作（相较于以前片面的内容，更为完整，系统化）\n 5. 各种研究机构开始出现\n\n详解：教育学（走向独立学科）的过程\n\n年份      代表人物    特征点\n1632年   夸美纽斯    班级授课的形式出现了（延续至今）\n1693年   洛克      教育三大件：德育、智育、体育\n1776年   康德      教育学进入大学课堂\n1781年   裴斯泰洛齐   教育学心理学化，与心理学密切结合\n1806年   赫尔巴特    继承夸美纽斯和裴斯泰洛齐，推动教育学由实践性制度走向学术性学科（祖师爷）\n\n\n# 2.1 发展出的教育学流派\n\n# 1. 实验教育学\n\n一切以实验研究为基础进行量化，产出结果\n\n假设 ——》实验 ——》 证明\n\n> 与赫尔巴特有对立性，强调实验，反对思辨（赫尔巴特强调思辨）\n\n优点：严谨性高，依据性强\n\n缺点：有唯科学主义的嫌疑，过度依赖实验\n\n# 2. 文化教育学\n\n是与实验教育学互相对立的教育学派，秉持人是一种文化存在。\n\n教育方针是：将人类的文化内化给学生\n\n精神或文化科学方法、思辨、陶冶情操、唤醒\n\n# 3. 实用主义教育学\n\n这个流派是杜威的，就是胡适那叼毛天天追捧的老师。但杜威本人确实在教育上造诣很深。\n\n疑问：为什么是对赫尔巴特的批判呢？\n\n# 4. 马克思主义教育学\n\n最早将其付诸实践的是毛子，是对马克思主义教育学部分的第一次实践\n\n教育是生产力再生产的过程\n\n是培养人全面发展的手段\n\n教育必须与生产劳动相结合\n\n> 番外问题：为什么容易机械化，教条话，甚至政治化？\n\n优点：充分应用马克思主义这一全新的唯物主义分析方法，具有相当的科学性\n\n缺点：实践中因为种种原因，很容易出现机械化、教条话、政治化的问题\n\n# 5. 制度教育学\n\n很多强调对于制度的批判，要分析制度，让制度为教育所用\n\n优点：重视制度\n\n缺点：过度依赖精神分析？\n\n# 6. 批判教育学\n\n1970年代\n\n注重敏感性，要对周边事物保持敏感性\n\n继承了马克思的批判方法\n\n批判了资本主义的教育\n\n但是批判的太深刻，却没有啥有用的改进方法\n\n\n# 2.2 回到当代教育学：进入理论深化阶段\n\n# 1. 新课改：用到的教育目标分类学\n\n将教育目标氛围认知、情感、动作，对教育评价有重大意义\n\n# 2. 知识结构学\n\n主张要让学生了解知识结构，结构很重要，用结构引导学生自己理解领悟\n\n# 3. 苏联教育思想\n\n实验，与教学最优化巴拉巴拉\n\n# 4. 我国的教育学思想\n\n中国的教育发展其实非常有历史，有很多研究\n\n研究的很广泛\n\n这个时期的教育学研究出现了很多新特征：\n\n * 问题领域光速扩大\n * 研究基础研究模式多样化\n * 细化特别多，很多都可以研究\n * 教育学研究与实践改革的关系更密切了\n * 教育学加强了对自身的反思，出现元原理（元化概念？）\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第二部分： 中国教育史\n\n教育史的学习的重要性仅次于教育学，要结合历史学习教育史\n\n中国古代教育史发展轨迹：\n\n儒学 --》经学（董仲舒） --》

Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?\n\nIt is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidizing the industry.\n\n确实，在许多国家，外国电影比国产电影更受欢迎。这可能是由几个原因造成的，我认为政府应该通过补贴产业来推动本地电影制作。\n\nThere are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films are examples of such productions and the global appeal that they have. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.\n\n许多人觉得外国电影比他们自己国家制作的电影更有趣的原因有很多。首先，某些国家的成熟电影产业拥有巨额预算用于动作场面、特效以及在壮观的地点拍摄场景。像《阿凡达》或詹姆斯·邦德电影这样的好莱坞大片就是此类制作的例子，以及它们所拥有的全球吸引力。这些大预算电影之所以如此成功，另一个原因是它们经常由最著名的演员和女演员主演，并由最有成就的制片人和导演制作。相比之下，许多国家的低质量、低成本的电影制作就显得逊色了。\n\nIn my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.\n\n在我看来，政府应该在财务上支持本地电影产业。在每个国家，都可能有才华横溢的业余电影制作者，他们只是需要机会来证明自己。为了与海外的大预算制作竞争，这些人需要资金来支付电影工作人员、演员以及与制作高质量电影相关的其他一系列费用。如果政府帮助承担这些费用，他们将看到电影产业的就业增加、电影销售收入增加，甚至可能会看到游客数量上升。例如，新西兰就因为部分由政府补贴的《指环王》电影而见证了旅游业的增长。\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.\n\n总之，我相信增加财务支持可以帮助提高本地制作电影的质量，并使它们能够与目前主导市场的外国制作竞争。\n\n\n# Simon S202 外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱\n\nForeign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\n\nIt is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. I completely disagree with this idea.\n\n有时候有人认为，来自海外的游客在参观重要的景点和纪念碑时，应该比当地居民支付更多的费用。我完全不同意这个观点。\n\nThe argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation, and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.\n\n支持对外国游客收取更高价格的论点是，文化或历史景点通常依赖国家补贴来维持运营，这意味着居民通过税收系统已经为这些景点支付了费用。然而，我认为这是一种非常短视的观点。外国游客通过在食品、纪念品、住宿和旅行等广泛的商品和服务上的消费为东道国的经济作出贡献。每个国家的政府和居民都应该乐于为重要的旅游景点提供补贴，并鼓励世界其他地方的人们来访。\n\nIf travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.\n\n如果游客意识到他们必须支付更多的费用才能参观某个国家的历史和文化景点，他们可能会决定不去那个国家度假。以英国为例，旅游业及许多相关工作依赖于游客来到该国参观温莎城堡或圣保罗大教堂等地方。这两个地点无论国籍都是同一价格，这有助于推广国家的文化遗产。如果由于价格较高而导致海外游客停止来访，那么这些重要建筑的维护资金可能会不足。\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.\n\n总之，我认为应该尽一切努力吸引海外游客，让他们支付比当地居民更多的费用将是适得其反的。\n\n\n# Simon S203 现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立\n\nSome people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.\n\n现代人对于我们现在是否比以前更依赖他人持有不同观点。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去更加独立。\n\nThere are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.\n\n现在我们更相互依赖的主要有两个原因。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，特别是生活成本显著增加。例如，年轻人在购买房屋时往往依靠父母的帮助。房价比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助，许多人将无法支付定金和抵押贷款。其次，现在的人似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依靠祖父母和保姆来帮助照顾孩子。\n\nHowever, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小且更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依赖亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行和远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去本地大学，这种经历使他们在学会独立生活时变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它使我们能够独自一人并在世界任何地方工作。\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.\n\n总之，虽然有些理由让人相信现在的人们更加相互依赖，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更独立。\n\n\n# Simon S204 选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水\n\nWhen choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nMany people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered. Personally, I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career, because I believe that other factors are equally important.\n\n人们对于现代生活中我们是否比以前更依赖他人这个问题持有不同的看法。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去的人更加独立。\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. For example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.\n\n有两个主要原因可以解释为什么我们现在可能更依赖彼此。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，尤其是因为生活成本的显著增加。例如，年轻成年人在购买房屋时往往依赖父母的帮助。房产价格比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助的话，许多人支付首付和按揭贷款是不可能的。其次，现在的人们似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依赖祖父母和保姆来照顾孩子。\n\nNevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers’ levels of happiness and general quality of life. Secondly, many people’s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. Finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更加独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小、更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依靠亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行，远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去当地的大学，这种经历使他们学会独自生活，变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它允许我们独自工作，从世界任何地方工作。\n\nIn conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people’s choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.\n\n总之，虽然有一些理由认为现在的人更依赖彼此，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更加独立。\n\n\n# Simon S205动物实验是否应该禁止\n\nNowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nIt is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.\n\n确实，在药物和其他产品被批准用于人类之前，通常会对动物进行测试。虽然我倾向于认为动物实验在道德上是错误的，但我必须支持为了药物开发而进行的有限数量的动物实验。\n\nOn the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.\n\n一方面，反对动物实验有明显的伦理论点。以这一做法的一个常见例子来说，实验室的老鼠可能会被赋予一种疾病，以便可以测量新药的效果。反对此类研究的人士认为，人类无权让动物承受这种创伤，所有生物的生命都应该受到尊重。他们认为，对人类的好处并不足以证明造成的痛苦，科学家应该使用研究的其他方法。\n\nOn the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.\n\n另一方面，可能并非总是有可靠的动物实验替代方案。支持在医学研究中使用动物的人认为，如果可以拯救人类生命，那么老鼠或大鼠所承受的某些痛苦是可以被证明的。他们争辩说，如果自己的家庭成员需要通过动物实验开发出来的医疗治疗，反对此类研究的人可能会有不同的感受。就我个人而言，我同意禁止非医疗产品的动物测试，但我觉得在新药和医疗程序方面，这可能是必要的恶。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.\n\n总之，在我看来，在开发出同样有效的替代方案之前，禁止对动物进行至关重要的医学研究测试将是错误的。\n\n\n# Simon S206 政府是否应该支持艺术工作者\n\nSome people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. Others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about the funding of creative artists. While some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.\n\n人们对资助创意艺术家持有不同的看法。虽然有些人不同意政府对艺术家提供支持，但我认为艺术项目的资金应该来自政府和其他来源。\n\nSome art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. They serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.\n\n有些艺术项目确实需要国家的帮助。在英国，公共空间中有很多艺术作品，比如市中心的街道或广场。例如，在利物浦，城市的码头区域最近经过重新开发，有几座新的雕像和雕塑。这些艺术品代表了文化、遗产和历史。它们的作用是教育人们了解这座城市，并作为游客和观光客的地标或谈资。政府和地方议会应该支付给创意艺术家费用来创作这类艺术，因为没有他们的资金支持，我们的城市将会失去很多趣味和吸引力。\n\nOn the other hand, I can understand the arguments against government funding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. For example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. These public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. Another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.\n\n另一方面，我能够理解反对政府资助艺术的观点。这种观点的主要理由是政府有更重要的事情要关心。例如，国家预算需要在教育、医疗保健、基础设施和安全等领域花费。这些公共服务对于一个国家的正常运作至关重要，而创意艺术家的工作，即使是在公共场所，也是一种奢侈。另一个原因是艺术家和其他专业人士一样，他们应该通过出售自己的作品来赚取自己的收入。\n\nIn conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.\n\n总之，艺术家依赖其他财务支持的来源是有充分理由的，但在我看来，有时政府的援助是必要的。\n\n\n# Simon S207 青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作\n\nSome people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nMany young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.\n\n许多年轻人以志愿者的身份工作，这对个人和整个社会都只有好处。然而，我不同意因此就应该强迫所有青少年做无偿工作。\n\nMost young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.\n\n大多数年轻人在学习上已经承受了足够的压力，无需再增加业余时间工作的责任。学校的要求就像全职工作一样，老师们期望学生们在每天上课之外还要做作业和复习考试。当年轻人有一些空闲时间时，我们应该鼓励他们与朋友一起享受或者进行体育和其他休闲活动。他们在完成学业后还有很多年的工作时间。\n\nAt the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.\n\n同时，我认为社会没有任何好处可以从强迫年轻人做无偿工作中获得。实际上，我认为这违背了自由和公平社会的价值观，强迫一群人做违背自己意愿的事。这样做只会导致年轻人产生怨恨，他们会感觉自己被利用，而父母则不希望别人告诉他们如何养育子女。目前，没有人被强迫做志愿者，这无疑是最好的系统。\n\nIn conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.\n\n总之，青少年可以选择免费工作并帮助他人，但在我看来，我们不应该将其强制化。\n\n\n# Simon S208 我们为什么需要音乐\n\nThere are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?\n\nIt is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.\n\n确实，世界各地可以找到丰富多样的音乐风格。音乐因多种原因成为所有人类文化的重要组成部分，我认为传统音乐比现代国际音乐更重要。\n\nMusic is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.\n\n音乐是伴随我们一生的东西。作为儿童，我们通过父母和老师教唱歌来学习语言，或仅仅作为一种享受。孩子们喜欢与他人一起唱歌，集体唱歌似乎能在参与者之间，不论年龄大小，建立一种联系。随着年龄的增长，人们的音乐喜好会发展变化，我们开始将最爱的歌曲视为生活故事的一部分。音乐以文字无法达到的方式表达和激发情感。简而言之，很难想象没有音乐的生活。\n\nIn my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.\n\n在我看来，应该更重视传统音乐而不是已经变得如此流行的国际音乐。国际流行音乐往往朗朗上口且有趣，但本质上它是商业人士市场推广和销售的商业产品。相比之下，传统音乐表达了一个国家的文化、习俗和历史。传统风格，例如...(例子)...，将我们与过去连接起来，构成我们文化身份的一部分。如果流行音乐变得如此主导以至于这些民族风格消失，那将是一种真正的遗憾。\n\nIn conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.\n\n总之，音乐是人类存在的必要部分，我相信传统音乐应该比国际音乐更重要。\n\n\n# Simon S209 电脑游戏是好还是坏呢\n\nSome people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?\n\nMany people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.\n\n许多人，特别是儿童，喜欢玩电脑游戏。虽然我接受这些游戏有时可以对用户产生积极影响，但我认为它们更可能产生有害的影响。\n\nOn the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.\n\n一方面，视频游戏既有趣又具有教育意义。用户或玩家被带入通常比现实生活更激动人心和更引人入胜的虚拟世界。从教育角度来看，这些游戏鼓励想象力和创造力，以及集中注意力、逻辑思维和解决问题的能力，这些都是游戏环境外的有用技能。此外，研究表明，计算机模拟游戏可以改善用户的运动技能，并帮助他们为现实世界的任务做准备，例如飞行。\n\nHowever, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.\n\n然而，我认为这些好处被缺点所掩盖。游戏可能非常容易上瘾，因为用户不断获得分数、新目标和频繁的奖励以保持他们的游戏兴趣。现在许多儿童每天花几小时试图通过游戏的各个级别或获得比朋友更高的分数。这种上瘾可以产生从缺乏睡眠到学校问题的各种影响，当作业被牺牲以换取在电脑或游戏机上的几个小时。近年来肥胖的增加也部分与经常伴随游戏成瘾的久坐生活方式和缺乏运动有关。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.\n\n总之，我认为视频游戏的潜在危险比可能的好处更为重要。\n\n\n# Simon S210 平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法\n\nIn the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.\n\nIt is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.\n\n确实，工业化国家的人们可以预期比以往任何时候都活得更长。虽然这一趋势无疑会带来一些负面后果，但社会可以采取措施来减轻这些潜在问题。\n\nAs people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.\n\n随着人们寿命延长和发达国家人口老龄化，可以预见到几个相关问题。主要问题是将明显有更多达到退休年龄并有资格领取养老金的人。年轻的工作成年人的比例将会减少，因此政府的税收相对于人口规模会减少。换句话说，人口老龄化将意味着工作成年人的税负加重。其他压力还包括对医疗保健的需求增加，以及年轻成年人将越来越需要照顾他们的老年亲戚的事实。\n\nThere are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.\n\n政府可以采取几项措施来解决上述问题。首先，一个简单的解决方案是提高工作成年人的退休年龄，可能从65岁提高到70岁。如今，这个年龄段的人往往足够健康，可以继续有效的工作生活。第二个措施是政府鼓励移民，以增加缴税的工作成年人的数量。最后，国家预算的资金将需要从其他领域调拨出来，用于为不断增加的老年公民提供必要的医疗、住宿和交通设施。\n\nIn conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.\n\n总之，随着国家人口老龄化，可以采取各种措施来解决必然出现的问题。\n\n\n# Simon S211 我们应该只关心自己的国家吗\n\nWe cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nSome people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.\n\n有些人认为，只要我们自己的社会中存在问题，我们就不应该帮助其他国家的人。我不同意这种观点，因为我认为我们应该尽可能帮助更多的人。\n\nOn the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.\n\n一方面，我接受帮助我们的邻居和同胞是重要的。在大多数社区中，都有一些贫困或以某种方式处于不利地位的人。例如，在即使是最富有的城市中也能找到无家可归的人，对于那些关心这个问题的人来说，通常有机会志愿投入时间或捐款支持这些人。在英国，人们可以通过多种方式帮助他人，从捐赠衣物到在汤厨房提供免费食物。由于问题就在我们的家门口，并且有明显的帮助方式，我可以理解为什么有些人觉得我们应该优先考虑本地慈善。\n\nAt the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.\n\n同时，我认为我们有义务帮助那些生活在我们国家边界之外的人。在一些国家，人们面临的问题比我们自己社区的问题要严重得多，而且帮助起来往往更容易。例如，当非洲国家的儿童因可治疗的疾病而死亡时，较富裕国家的政府和个人只需支付已有疫苗的费用就可以挽救生命。对国际慈善机构的小额捐款可能比在我们当地帮助的影响要大得多。\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.\n\n总之，虽然我们无法帮助所有人，但我认为国家界限不应阻止我们帮助那些有需要的人。\n\n\n# Simon S212 科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的\n\nNowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?\n\nIt is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.\n\n确实，新技术对人们之间的沟通产生了影响。技术以各种方式影响了人际关系，我认为这些影响既有积极的也有消极的。\n\nTechnology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. Secondly, services like Skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.\n\n技术对商业、教育和社交生活中的人际关系产生了影响。首先，电话和互联网使不同国家的商务人士能够进行交流，而不需要面对面会面。其次，如Skype这样的服务为学生和老师之间的关系创造了新的可能性。例如，学生现在可以通过视频与不同城市或国家的老师上课。最后，许多人使用社交网络，如Facebook，来结交新朋友和寻找有共同兴趣的人，并通过计算机而不是面对面进行交流。\n\nOn the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.\n\n一方面，这些发展可以非常积极。当通信只限于书信或电报时，不同国家的人们之间的合作要困难得多。如今，通过电子邮件、电话或视频的互动几乎与面对面会议一样好，我们许多人都从这些互动中受益，无论是在工作还是社交环境中。另一方面，新通信技术的可用性也可能导致人们孤立和阻碍真实的互动。例如，许多年轻人选择在线交友而不是与现实世界中的同龄人混在一起，而这些“虚拟”关系是对真实友谊的糟糕替代。\n\nIn conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.\n\n总之，技术确实彻底改变了人与人之间的沟通方式，但这场革命的结果并非全都是积极的。\n\n\n# Simon S213 兴趣爱好应该是很困难的\n\nSome people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nSome hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.\n\n有些爱好相对容易，而其他爱好则更具挑战性。我个人认为，两种类型的爱好都可以很有趣，因此我不同意爱好需要具有难度才能享受的说法。\n\nOn the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.\n\n一方面，许多人喜欢简单的爱好。一个对大多数人来说容易的活动示例是游泳。这项爱好需要的设备很少，学起来简单，而且不昂贵。我记得小时候在当地的游泳池学游泳，从来没有觉得那是一种要求高或有挑战性的经历。另一个我觉得简单有趣的爱好是摄影。在我看来，任何人都可以在不太了解操作相机的技术细节的情况下拍摄有趣的照片。尽管过程直接，但摄影是一项令人满足的活动。\n\nOn the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. If an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. In my case, it took me around two years before I became competent at this activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. I believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.\n\n另一方面，困难的爱好有时候可以更加令人兴奋。如果一项活动更具挑战性，当我们成功完成时，我们可能会感到更大的满足感。例如，电影剪辑是一项需要高水平知识和专业技能的爱好。在我自己的例子中，我花了大约两年时间才在这项活动中变得熟练，但现在我享受它的程度远超过我开始时的情况。我相信，当我们在许多爱好中达到更高的表现水平时，我们会获得更多的快乐，因为结果更好，成就感也更大。\n\nIn conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.\n\n总之，简单的爱好可以是有趣和放松的，但困难的爱好也可以因为不同的原因带来同样的乐趣。\n\n\n# Simon S214 平等社会和个人成就之间的关系\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?\n\nIn my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. I completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.\n\n在我看来，平等主义社会是每个人都拥有相同权利和机会的社会。我完全同意在这种社会中，人们可以实现更多。\n\nEducation is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. I believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. In a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. This kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.\n\n教育是个人生活成功的重要因素。我认为所有儿童都应该有机会接受免费教育，高等教育应该对所有选择追求大学学位的人免费或者负担得起。在一个没有免费学校教育或高等教育负担得起的社会里，只有来自较富裕家庭的儿童和年轻人才能获得最好的学习机会，因此他们会为就业市场做好更充分的准备。这种不平等将确保一些人的成功，但损害其他人的前景。\n\nI would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people’s freedom to succeed or fail. In other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. On the contrary, I believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. Those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. Inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.\n\n我认为平等的权利和机会并不与人们成功或失败的自由相冲突。换句话说，平等并不意味着人们失去了成功的动机，或者他们不被允许失败。相反，我相信如果大多数人认为他们生活在一个公平的社会中，他们会更有动力努力工作并实现他们的潜能。那些没有做出同样努力的人会知道他们浪费了机会。另一方面，不平等更有可能使人们失去动力，因为他们会知道成功的机会更倾向于那些来自有特权背景的人。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.\n\n总之，在我看来，平等与个人成功之间存在正相关关系。\n\n\n# Simon S215 大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等\n\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nIn my opinion, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.\n\n在我看来，男性和女性应该拥有相同的教育机会。然而，我不同意在每个大学科目中接受每个性别相等比例的观点。\n\nHaving the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. If a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. For example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.\n\n在所有学位课程中拥有相同数量的男性和女性简直是不现实的。任何课程的学生人数都取决于该机构收到的申请。如果大学决定让男女生人数相等，它需要每个性别足够的申请者。实际上，许多课程对一种性别比另一种更受欢迎，力求性别比例平等并不切实际。例如，护理课程往往吸引更多女性申请者，如果需要50%的名额分配给男性，这些课程将难以招满。\n\nApart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.\n\n除了上述实际问题，我还认为基于性别确定大学课程的录取是不公平的。大学应该继续根据他们的资格选择每个课程的最佳候选人。通过这种方式，男性和女性拥有相同的机会，申请者知道如果他们努力在学校取得好成绩就会成功。如果一名女学生是课程名额的最佳候选人，因为性别原因拒绝她而选择成绩较低或资格较少的男学生显然是错误的。\n\nIn conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.\n\n总之，大学学生的选拔应基于功绩，改为基于性别的选拔程序既不切实际也不公平。\n\n\n# Simon S216 博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育\n\nSome people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.Discuss both views and give you own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.\n\n人们对博物馆的作用和功能有不同的看法。我认为，博物馆既可以也应该既有趣又具有教育意义。\n\nOn the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.\n\n一方面，可以认为博物馆的主要角色是娱乐。博物馆是旅游景点，其目的是展示许多人想看的一系列有趣物品。如果普通访客必须阅读或听太多教育内容，可能会感到无聊，因此博物馆通常更注重享受而不是学习。这种类型的博物馆旨在视觉上壮观，并可能在展览中包含互动活动甚至游戏。\n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science, and many other aspects of life.\n\n另一方面，有些人认为博物馆应该专注于教育。任何展览的目的应该是教给游客他们以前不知道的东西。这通常意味着需要解释博物馆展品背后的历史，这可以通过多种方式完成。一些博物馆雇用专业导游与游客交谈，而其他博物馆提供耳机，让游客可以听关于展览的详细解说。通过这种方式，博物馆可以在教育人们了解历史、文化、科学以及生活的许多其他方面发挥重要作用。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.\n\n总之，我认为一个好的博物馆应该能够提供一个有趣、愉快和具有教育意义的体验，这样人们可以在玩乐的同时学到东西。\n\n\n# Simon S217 应该上大学还是应该直接找工作\n\nSome people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nWhen they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.\n\n当青少年完成学业时，他们面临着是找工作还是继续深造的困境。尽管刚从学校毕业后直接找工作有一些好处，但我认为上大学或大专更好。\n\nThe option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.\n\n直接在学校毕业后开始工作的选项因几个原因而具有吸引力。许多年轻人希望尽快开始挣钱。通过这种方式，他们可以变得独立，并将能够负担得起自己的房子或开始组建家庭。就职业而言，选择找工作而不是继续学业的年轻人可能会更快进步。他们将有机会获得真实经验并学习与所选职业相关的实用技能。这可能会带来晋升和成功的职业生涯。\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher, or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.\n\n另一方面，我认为学生继续学习更有益。首先，许多职业需要学术资格。例如，没有相关学位就不可能成为医生、教师或律师。因此，大学毕业生可以获得更多更好的工作机会，他们的薪水通常也比那些学历较低的人高。其次，就业市场竞争越来越激烈，有时一家公司的一个职位可能有数百名申请者。没有大学或学院学历的年轻人将无法竞争。\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.\n\n基于上述原因，我认为如果学生在学校层次之外继续学习，他们在职业生涯中更有可能取得成功。\n\n\n# Simon S218 政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言\n\nSeveral languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.\n\nIt is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.\n\n确实，一些少数民族语言可能在不久的将来消失。尽管可以认为，政府通过允许这种情况发生可以节省资金，但我认为应该保护和保存这些语言。\n\nThere are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers, and marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.\n\n保存少数民族语言可能被视为浪费资金有几个原因。首先，如果一种语言只有少数人说，将需要昂贵的教育计划以确保更多人学习它，而国家将不得不支付设施、教师和市场营销的费用。这些钱可能更应该用于其他公共服务。其次，对于国家来说，只有一种语言会更便宜且更高效。政府可以削减与每个少数群体沟通相关的各种成本。\n\nDespite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs, and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.\n\n尽管有上述论点，我认为政府应该努力保存较少使用的语言。语言不仅仅是交流的工具；它与说这种语言的人的文化身份有着重要的联系。如果一种语言消失，一整种生活方式也会随之消失，我们将失去使社会更有趣的丰富文化多样性。通过花钱保护少数民族语言，政府还可以保存构成国家历史的传统、习俗和行为。\n\nIn conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term, this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.\n\n总之，如果我们允许少数民族语言消失，短期内可能会节省资金，但从长远来看，这将对我们的文化遗产产生极其负面的影响。\n\n\n# Simon S219 环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么\n\nExplain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment. What can governments do to address these problems? What can individual people do?\n\nHumans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet. This essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.\n\n人类对许多环境问题负有责任，但我们也可以采取措施减少我们对地球的破坏。本文将讨论环境问题以及政府和个人可以采取的措施。\n\nTwo of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.\n\n环境面临的两大威胁是空气污染和废物。工厂的气体排放和车辆的尾气排放导致全球变暖，这可能在未来对地球产生毁灭性的影响。随着人口的增加，我们也在产生越来越多的废物，这些废物污染了土地并且污染了河流和海洋。\n\nGovernments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.\n\n政府当然可以采取更多措施来减少空气污染。他们可以制定法律限制工厂排放，或强制公司使用来自太阳能、风能或水能的可再生能源。他们还可以对驾驶者和航空公司征收“绿色税”。通过这种方式，人们将被鼓励使用公共交通并减少出国航班，从而减少排放。\n\nIndividuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. They can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for recycling glass, plastic, and paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.\n\n个人也应对他们对环境的影响负责。他们可以乘坐公共交通工具而不是驾车，选择包装较少的产品，并尽可能多地回收。现在大多数超市为购物者提供可重复使用的袋子，并在停车场设有回收玻璃、塑料和纸张的“回收站”。通过重复使用和回收，我们可以帮助减少废物。\n\nIn conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.\n\n总之，国家政府和个人都必须在照顾环境方面发挥作用。\n\n\n# Simon S220 为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福\n\nHappiness is considered very important in life. Why is it difficult to define? What factors are important in achieving happiness?\n\nIt is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. While the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.\n\n毫无疑问，大多数人希望在他们的生活中感到快乐。虽然快乐的个人本质使得它难以描述，但似乎确实存在一些我们都共有的关于体验或实现快乐的共同需求。\n\nHappiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. Nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take pleasure. Some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are much more important. At the same time, a range of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.\n\n快乐难以定义，因为对每个人来说意味着不同的事情。没有人能完全理解或体验另一个人的感受，我们都有自己特定的激情，从中获取快乐。例如，有些人从赚钱或取得成功中获得满足感，而对其他人来说，健康和家庭更为重要。同时，从兴奋到平和的一系列其他感受可能与快乐的概念相关联，因此同一个人可能会以多种不同的方式感到快乐。\n\nAlthough it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving it. Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. Our basic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasant life. Secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. Other key factors could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life.\n\n尽管给快乐下一个准确的定义似乎几乎不可能，但大多数人会同意实现快乐有一些基本前提条件。首先，如果一个人没有安全的居住环境和足够的食物，他或她很难感到快乐。我们的基本生存需求必须首先得到满足，之后我们才能过上愉快的生活。其次，生活中最大的快乐通常来自与家人和朋友的共同经历，很少有人满足于完全孤立地生活。其他关键因素可能是个人自由和生活的目标感。\n\nIn conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each individual, but I believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.\n\n总之，快乐难以定义，因为它对每个人都是特定的，但我相信我们在体验快乐之前需要满足住所、食物和陪伴的基本需求。\n\n\n# Simon S221 你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源\n\nWild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nSome people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I completely disagree with this point of view.\n\nIn my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21stcentury. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world’s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.\n\nI also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth’s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.\n\n\n# Simon S222 严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗\n\nSome people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.\n\nOn the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that donot punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.\n\nIn conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.\n\n\n# Simon S223 企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任\n\nAs well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nBusinesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.\n\nOn the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.\n\nOn the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.\n\n\n# Simon S224 政府如何让城市生活更美好\n\nMore and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?\n\nCities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.\n\nThe main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.\n\nHowever, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.\n\nIn conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.\n\n\n# Simon S225 现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢\n\nIn some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\n\nIn recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.\n\nThe rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.\n\nHowever, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.\n\n\n# Simon S226 大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的\n\nSome people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.\n\nThere are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.\n\nIn spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.\n\nIn conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.\n\n\n# Simon S227 让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪\n\nSome people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree? It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.\n\nIn my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.\n\nThe alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. One option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. This could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. A second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. Finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.\n\nIn conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.\n\n\n# Simon S228 传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地\n\nThe older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?\n\nIt is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.\n\nOn the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.\n\nOn the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.\n\nIn conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.",normalizedContent:"# simon s201 政府是否该支持本土电影\n\nmany people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. why could this be? should governments give more financial support to local film industries?\n\nit is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. there could be several reasons why this is the case, and i believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidizing the industry.\n\n确实，在许多国家，外国电影比国产电影更受欢迎。这可能是由几个原因造成的，我认为政府应该通过补贴产业来推动本地电影制作。\n\nthere are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. hollywood blockbusters like ‘avatar’ or the james bond films are examples of such productions and the global appeal that they have. another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. the poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.\n\n许多人觉得外国电影比他们自己国家制作的电影更有趣的原因有很多。首先，某些国家的成熟电影产业拥有巨额预算用于动作场面、特效以及在壮观的地点拍摄场景。像《阿凡达》或詹姆斯·邦德电影这样的好莱坞大片就是此类制作的例子，以及它们所拥有的全球吸引力。这些大预算电影之所以如此成功，另一个原因是它们经常由最著名的演员和女演员主演，并由最有成就的制片人和导演制作。相比之下，许多国家的低质量、低成本的电影制作就显得逊色了。\n\nin my view, governments should support local film industries financially. in every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. to compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. if governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. new zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'lord of the rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.\n\n在我看来，政府应该在财务上支持本地电影产业。在每个国家，都可能有才华横溢的业余电影制作者，他们只是需要机会来证明自己。为了与海外的大预算制作竞争，这些人需要资金来支付电影工作人员、演员以及与制作高质量电影相关的其他一系列费用。如果政府帮助承担这些费用，他们将看到电影产业的就业增加、电影销售收入增加，甚至可能会看到游客数量上升。例如，新西兰就因为部分由政府补贴的《指环王》电影而见证了旅游业的增长。\n\nin conclusion, i believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.\n\n总之，我相信增加财务支持可以帮助提高本地制作电影的质量，并使它们能够与目前主导市场的外国制作竞争。\n\n\n# simon s202 外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱\n\nforeign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\n\nit is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. i completely disagree with this idea.\n\n有时候有人认为，来自海外的游客在参观重要的景点和纪念碑时，应该比当地居民支付更多的费用。我完全不同意这个观点。\n\nthe argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. however, i believe this to be a very shortsighted view. foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation, and travel. the governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.\n\n支持对外国游客收取更高价格的论点是，文化或历史景点通常依赖国家补贴来维持运营，这意味着居民通过税收系统已经为这些景点支付了费用。然而，我认为这是一种非常短视的观点。外国游客通过在食品、纪念品、住宿和旅行等广泛的商品和服务上的消费为东道国的经济作出贡献。每个国家的政府和居民都应该乐于为重要的旅游景点提供补贴，并鼓励世界其他地方的人们来访。\n\nif travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. to take the uk as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like windsor castle or saint paul’s cathedral. these two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. if overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.\n\n如果游客意识到他们必须支付更多的费用才能参观某个国家的历史和文化景点，他们可能会决定不去那个国家度假。以英国为例，旅游业及许多相关工作依赖于游客来到该国参观温莎城堡或圣保罗大教堂等地方。这两个地点无论国籍都是同一价格，这有助于推广国家的文化遗产。如果由于价格较高而导致海外游客停止来访，那么这些重要建筑的维护资金可能会不足。\n\nin conclusion, i believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.\n\n总之，我认为应该尽一切努力吸引海外游客，让他们支付比当地居民更多的费用将是适得其反的。\n\n\n# simon s203 现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立\n\nsome people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. in my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.\n\n现代人对于我们现在是否比以前更依赖他人持有不同观点。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去更加独立。\n\nthere are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. for example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. this means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.\n\n现在我们更相互依赖的主要有两个原因。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，特别是生活成本显著增加。例如，年轻人在购买房屋时往往依靠父母的帮助。房价比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助，许多人将无法支付定金和抵押贷款。其次，现在的人似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依靠祖父母和保姆来帮助照顾孩子。\n\nhowever, i would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. in most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. we also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. for example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小且更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依赖亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行和远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去本地大学，这种经历使他们在学会独立生活时变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它使我们能够独自一人并在世界任何地方工作。\n\nin conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.\n\n总之，虽然有些理由让人相信现在的人们更加相互依赖，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更独立。\n\n\n# simon s204 选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水\n\nwhen choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nmany people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered. personally, i disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career, because i believe that other factors are equally important.\n\n人们对于现代生活中我们是否比以前更依赖他人这个问题持有不同的看法。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去的人更加独立。\n\non the one hand, i agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. for example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. if people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.\n\n有两个主要原因可以解释为什么我们现在可能更依赖彼此。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，尤其是因为生活成本的显著增加。例如，年轻成年人在购买房屋时往往依赖父母的帮助。房产价格比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助的话，许多人支付首付和按揭贷款是不可能的。其次，现在的人们似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依赖祖父母和保姆来照顾孩子。\n\nnevertheless, i believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers’ levels of happiness and general quality of life. secondly, many people’s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更加独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小、更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依靠亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行，远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去当地的大学，这种经历使他们学会独自生活，变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它允许我们独自工作，从世界任何地方工作。\n\nin conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people’s choice of profession, i do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.\n\n总之，虽然有一些理由认为现在的人更依赖彼此，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更加独立。\n\n\n# simon s205动物实验是否应该禁止\n\nnowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nit is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. while i tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, i would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.\n\n确实，在药物和其他产品被批准用于人类之前，通常会对动物进行测试。虽然我倾向于认为动物实验在道德上是错误的，但我必须支持为了药物开发而进行的有限数量的动物实验。\n\non the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. to use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. they believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.\n\n一方面，反对动物实验有明显的伦理论点。以这一做法的一个常见例子来说，实验室的老鼠可能会被赋予一种疾病，以便可以测量新药的效果。反对此类研究的人士认为，人类无权让动物承受这种创伤，所有生物的生命都应该受到尊重。他们认为，对人类的好处并不足以证明造成的痛苦，科学家应该使用研究的其他方法。\n\non the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. they argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. personally, i agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but i feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.\n\n另一方面，可能并非总是有可靠的动物实验替代方案。支持在医学研究中使用动物的人认为，如果可以拯救人类生命，那么老鼠或大鼠所承受的某些痛苦是可以被证明的。他们争辩说，如果自己的家庭成员需要通过动物实验开发出来的医疗治疗，反对此类研究的人可能会有不同的感受。就我个人而言，我同意禁止非医疗产品的动物测试，但我觉得在新药和医疗程序方面，这可能是必要的恶。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.\n\n总之，在我看来，在开发出同样有效的替代方案之前，禁止对动物进行至关重要的医学研究测试将是错误的。\n\n\n# simon s206 政府是否应该支持艺术工作者\n\nsome people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about the funding of creative artists. while some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, i believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.\n\n人们对资助创意艺术家持有不同的看法。虽然有些人不同意政府对艺术家提供支持，但我认为艺术项目的资金应该来自政府和其他来源。\n\nsome art projects definitely require help from the state. in the uk, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. in liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. these artworks represent culture, heritage and history. they serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.\n\n有些艺术项目确实需要国家的帮助。在英国，公共空间中有很多艺术作品，比如市中心的街道或广场。例如，在利物浦，城市的码头区域最近经过重新开发，有几座新的雕像和雕塑。这些艺术品代表了文化、遗产和历史。它们的作用是教育人们了解这座城市，并作为游客和观光客的地标或谈资。政府和地方议会应该支付给创意艺术家费用来创作这类艺术，因为没有他们的资金支持，我们的城市将会失去很多趣味和吸引力。\n\non the other hand, i can understand the arguments against government funding for art. the main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. for example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. these public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.\n\n另一方面，我能够理解反对政府资助艺术的观点。这种观点的主要理由是政府有更重要的事情要关心。例如，国家预算需要在教育、医疗保健、基础设施和安全等领域花费。这些公共服务对于一个国家的正常运作至关重要，而创意艺术家的工作，即使是在公共场所，也是一种奢侈。另一个原因是艺术家和其他专业人士一样，他们应该通过出售自己的作品来赚取自己的收入。\n\nin conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.\n\n总之，艺术家依赖其他财务支持的来源是有充分理由的，但在我看来，有时政府的援助是必要的。\n\n\n# simon s207 青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作\n\nsome people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. they believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. do you agree or disagree?\n\nmany young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. however, i do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.\n\n许多年轻人以志愿者的身份工作，这对个人和整个社会都只有好处。然而，我不同意因此就应该强迫所有青少年做无偿工作。\n\nmost young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. school is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. when young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. they have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.\n\n大多数年轻人在学习上已经承受了足够的压力，无需再增加业余时间工作的责任。学校的要求就像全职工作一样，老师们期望学生们在每天上课之外还要做作业和复习考试。当年轻人有一些空闲时间时，我们应该鼓励他们与朋友一起享受或者进行体育和其他休闲活动。他们在完成学业后还有很多年的工作时间。\n\nat the same time, i do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. in fact, i would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.\n\n同时，我认为社会没有任何好处可以从强迫年轻人做无偿工作中获得。实际上，我认为这违背了自由和公平社会的价值观，强迫一群人做违背自己意愿的事。这样做只会导致年轻人产生怨恨，他们会感觉自己被利用，而父母则不希望别人告诉他们如何养育子女。目前，没有人被强迫做志愿者，这无疑是最好的系统。\n\nin conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.\n\n总之，青少年可以选择免费工作并帮助他人，但在我看来，我们不应该将其强制化。\n\n\n# simon s208 我们为什么需要音乐\n\nthere are many different types of music in the world today. why do we need music? is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?\n\nit is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and i would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.\n\n确实，世界各地可以找到丰富多样的音乐风格。音乐因多种原因成为所有人类文化的重要组成部分，我认为传统音乐比现代国际音乐更重要。\n\nmusic is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. as children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. in short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.\n\n音乐是伴随我们一生的东西。作为儿童，我们通过父母和老师教唱歌来学习语言，或仅仅作为一种享受。孩子们喜欢与他人一起唱歌，集体唱歌似乎能在参与者之间，不论年龄大小，建立一种联系。随着年龄的增长，人们的音乐喜好会发展变化，我们开始将最爱的歌曲视为生活故事的一部分。音乐以文字无法达到的方式表达和激发情感。简而言之，很难想象没有音乐的生活。\n\nin my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. international pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. it would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.\n\n在我看来，应该更重视传统音乐而不是已经变得如此流行的国际音乐。国际流行音乐往往朗朗上口且有趣，但本质上它是商业人士市场推广和销售的商业产品。相比之下，传统音乐表达了一个国家的文化、习俗和历史。传统风格，例如...(例子)...，将我们与过去连接起来，构成我们文化身份的一部分。如果流行音乐变得如此主导以至于这些民族风格消失，那将是一种真正的遗憾。\n\nin conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and i believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.\n\n总之，音乐是人类存在的必要部分，我相信传统音乐应该比国际音乐更重要。\n\n\n# simon s209 电脑游戏是好还是坏呢\n\nsome people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. in your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?\n\nmany people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. while i accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, i believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.\n\n许多人，特别是儿童，喜欢玩电脑游戏。虽然我接受这些游戏有时可以对用户产生积极影响，但我认为它们更可能产生有害的影响。\n\non the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. from an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.\n\n一方面，视频游戏既有趣又具有教育意义。用户或玩家被带入通常比现实生活更激动人心和更引人入胜的虚拟世界。从教育角度来看，这些游戏鼓励想象力和创造力，以及集中注意力、逻辑思维和解决问题的能力，这些都是游戏环境外的有用技能。此外，研究表明，计算机模拟游戏可以改善用户的运动技能，并帮助他们为现实世界的任务做准备，例如飞行。\n\nhowever, i would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. this type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. the rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.\n\n然而，我认为这些好处被缺点所掩盖。游戏可能非常容易上瘾，因为用户不断获得分数、新目标和频繁的奖励以保持他们的游戏兴趣。现在许多儿童每天花几小时试图通过游戏的各个级别或获得比朋友更高的分数。这种上瘾可以产生从缺乏睡眠到学校问题的各种影响，当作业被牺牲以换取在电脑或游戏机上的几个小时。近年来肥胖的增加也部分与经常伴随游戏成瘾的久坐生活方式和缺乏运动有关。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.\n\n总之，我认为视频游戏的潜在危险比可能的好处更为重要。\n\n\n# simon s210 平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法\n\nin the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. what problems will this cause for individuals and society? suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.\n\nit is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.\n\n确实，工业化国家的人们可以预期比以往任何时候都活得更长。虽然这一趋势无疑会带来一些负面后果，但社会可以采取措施来减轻这些潜在问题。\n\nas people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. the main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. the proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. in other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.\n\n随着人们寿命延长和发达国家人口老龄化，可以预见到几个相关问题。主要问题是将明显有更多达到退休年龄并有资格领取养老金的人。年轻的工作成年人的比例将会减少，因此政府的税收相对于人口规模会减少。换句话说，人口老龄化将意味着工作成年人的税负加重。其他压力还包括对医疗保健的需求增加，以及年轻成年人将越来越需要照顾他们的老年亲戚的事实。\n\nthere are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. a second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.\n\n政府可以采取几项措施来解决上述问题。首先，一个简单的解决方案是提高工作成年人的退休年龄，可能从65岁提高到70岁。如今，这个年龄段的人往往足够健康，可以继续有效的工作生活。第二个措施是政府鼓励移民，以增加缴税的工作成年人的数量。最后，国家预算的资金将需要从其他领域调拨出来，用于为不断增加的老年公民提供必要的医疗、住宿和交通设施。\n\nin conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.\n\n总之，随着国家人口老龄化，可以采取各种措施来解决必然出现的问题。\n\n\n# simon s211 我们应该只关心自己的国家吗\n\nwe cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nsome people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. i disagree with this view because i believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.\n\n有些人认为，只要我们自己的社会中存在问题，我们就不应该帮助其他国家的人。我不同意这种观点，因为我认为我们应该尽可能帮助更多的人。\n\non the one hand, i accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. in most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. it is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. in the uk, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. as the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, i can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.\n\n一方面，我接受帮助我们的邻居和同胞是重要的。在大多数社区中，都有一些贫困或以某种方式处于不利地位的人。例如，在即使是最富有的城市中也能找到无家可归的人，对于那些关心这个问题的人来说，通常有机会志愿投入时间或捐款支持这些人。在英国，人们可以通过多种方式帮助他人，从捐赠衣物到在汤厨房提供免费食物。由于问题就在我们的家门口，并且有明显的帮助方式，我可以理解为什么有些人觉得我们应该优先考虑本地慈善。\n\nat the same time, i believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. in some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. for example, when children are dying from curable diseases in african countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. a small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.\n\n同时，我认为我们有义务帮助那些生活在我们国家边界之外的人。在一些国家，人们面临的问题比我们自己社区的问题要严重得多，而且帮助起来往往更容易。例如，当非洲国家的儿童因可治疗的疾病而死亡时，较富裕国家的政府和个人只需支付已有疫苗的费用就可以挽救生命。对国际慈善机构的小额捐款可能比在我们当地帮助的影响要大得多。\n\nin conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.\n\n总之，虽然我们无法帮助所有人，但我认为国家界限不应阻止我们帮助那些有需要的人。\n\n\n# simon s212 科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的\n\nnowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. in what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? has this been a positive or negative development?\n\nit is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.\n\n确实，新技术对人们之间的沟通产生了影响。技术以各种方式影响了人际关系，我认为这些影响既有积极的也有消极的。\n\ntechnology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. firstly, telephones and the internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. secondly, services like skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. for example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. finally, many people use social networks, like facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.\n\n技术对商业、教育和社交生活中的人际关系产生了影响。首先，电话和互联网使不同国家的商务人士能够进行交流，而不需要面对面会面。其次，如skype这样的服务为学生和老师之间的关系创造了新的可能性。例如，学生现在可以通过视频与不同城市或国家的老师上课。最后，许多人使用社交网络，如facebook，来结交新朋友和寻找有共同兴趣的人，并通过计算机而不是面对面进行交流。\n\non the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. on the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. for example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.\n\n一方面，这些发展可以非常积极。当通信只限于书信或电报时，不同国家的人们之间的合作要困难得多。如今，通过电子邮件、电话或视频的互动几乎与面对面会议一样好，我们许多人都从这些互动中受益，无论是在工作还是社交环境中。另一方面，新通信技术的可用性也可能导致人们孤立和阻碍真实的互动。例如，许多年轻人选择在线交友而不是与现实世界中的同龄人混在一起，而这些“虚拟”关系是对真实友谊的糟糕替代。\n\nin conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.\n\n总之，技术确实彻底改变了人与人之间的沟通方式，但这场革命的结果并非全都是积极的。\n\n\n# simon s213 兴趣爱好应该是很困难的\n\nsome people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nsome hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. personally, i believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and i therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.\n\n有些爱好相对容易，而其他爱好则更具挑战性。我个人认为，两种类型的爱好都可以很有趣，因此我不同意爱好需要具有难度才能享受的说法。\n\non the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. one example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. this hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. i remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when i was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. another hobby that i find easy and fun is photography. in my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.\n\n一方面，许多人喜欢简单的爱好。一个对大多数人来说容易的活动示例是游泳。这项爱好需要的设备很少，学起来简单，而且不昂贵。我记得小时候在当地的游泳池学游泳，从来没有觉得那是一种要求高或有挑战性的经历。另一个我觉得简单有趣的爱好是摄影。在我看来，任何人都可以在不太了解操作相机的技术细节的情况下拍摄有趣的照片。尽管过程直接，但摄影是一项令人满足的活动。\n\non the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. if an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. for example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. in my case, it took me around two years before i became competent at this activity, but now i enjoy it much more than i did when i started. i believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.\n\n另一方面，困难的爱好有时候可以更加令人兴奋。如果一项活动更具挑战性，当我们成功完成时，我们可能会感到更大的满足感。例如，电影剪辑是一项需要高水平知识和专业技能的爱好。在我自己的例子中，我花了大约两年时间才在这项活动中变得熟练，但现在我享受它的程度远超过我开始时的情况。我相信，当我们在许多爱好中达到更高的表现水平时，我们会获得更多的快乐，因为结果更好，成就感也更大。\n\nin conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.\n\n总之，简单的爱好可以是有趣和放松的，但困难的爱好也可以因为不同的原因带来同样的乐趣。\n\n\n# simon s214 平等社会和个人成就之间的关系\n\nin recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. what is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?\n\nin my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. i completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.\n\n在我看来，平等主义社会是每个人都拥有相同权利和机会的社会。我完全同意在这种社会中，人们可以实现更多。\n\neducation is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. i believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. in a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. this kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.\n\n教育是个人生活成功的重要因素。我认为所有儿童都应该有机会接受免费教育，高等教育应该对所有选择追求大学学位的人免费或者负担得起。在一个没有免费学校教育或高等教育负担得起的社会里，只有来自较富裕家庭的儿童和年轻人才能获得最好的学习机会，因此他们会为就业市场做好更充分的准备。这种不平等将确保一些人的成功，但损害其他人的前景。\n\ni would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people’s freedom to succeed or fail. in other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. on the contrary, i believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.\n\n我认为平等的权利和机会并不与人们成功或失败的自由相冲突。换句话说，平等并不意味着人们失去了成功的动机，或者他们不被允许失败。相反，我相信如果大多数人认为他们生活在一个公平的社会中，他们会更有动力努力工作并实现他们的潜能。那些没有做出同样努力的人会知道他们浪费了机会。另一方面，不平等更有可能使人们失去动力，因为他们会知道成功的机会更倾向于那些来自有特权背景的人。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.\n\n总之，在我看来，平等与个人成功之间存在正相关关系。\n\n\n# simon s215 大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等\n\nuniversities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nin my opinion, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. however, i do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.\n\n在我看来，男性和女性应该拥有相同的教育机会。然而，我不同意在每个大学科目中接受每个性别相等比例的观点。\n\nhaving the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. if a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. in reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. for example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.\n\n在所有学位课程中拥有相同数量的男性和女性简直是不现实的。任何课程的学生人数都取决于该机构收到的申请。如果大学决定让男女生人数相等，它需要每个性别足够的申请者。实际上，许多课程对一种性别比另一种更受欢迎，力求性别比例平等并不切实际。例如，护理课程往往吸引更多女性申请者，如果需要50%的名额分配给男性，这些课程将难以招满。\n\napart from the practical concerns expressed above, i also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. in this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. if a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.\n\n除了上述实际问题，我还认为基于性别确定大学课程的录取是不公平的。大学应该继续根据他们的资格选择每个课程的最佳候选人。通过这种方式，男性和女性拥有相同的机会，申请者知道如果他们努力在学校取得好成绩就会成功。如果一名女学生是课程名额的最佳候选人，因为性别原因拒绝她而选择成绩较低或资格较少的男学生显然是错误的。\n\nin conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.\n\n总之，大学学生的选拔应基于功绩，改为基于性别的选拔程序既不切实际也不公平。\n\n\n# simon s216 博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育\n\nsome people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.discuss both views and give you own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about the role and function of museums. in my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.\n\n人们对博物馆的作用和功能有不同的看法。我认为，博物馆既可以也应该既有趣又具有教育意义。\n\non the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. the average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. this type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.\n\n一方面，可以认为博物馆的主要角色是娱乐。博物馆是旅游景点，其目的是展示许多人想看的一系列有趣物品。如果普通访客必须阅读或听太多教育内容，可能会感到无聊，因此博物馆通常更注重享受而不是学习。这种类型的博物馆旨在视觉上壮观，并可能在展览中包含互动活动甚至游戏。\n\non the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. the aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. in this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science, and many other aspects of life.\n\n另一方面，有些人认为博物馆应该专注于教育。任何展览的目的应该是教给游客他们以前不知道的东西。这通常意味着需要解释博物馆展品背后的历史，这可以通过多种方式完成。一些博物馆雇用专业导游与游客交谈，而其他博物馆提供耳机，让游客可以听关于展览的详细解说。通过这种方式，博物馆可以在教育人们了解历史、文化、科学以及生活的许多其他方面发挥重要作用。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.\n\n总之，我认为一个好的博物馆应该能够提供一个有趣、愉快和具有教育意义的体验，这样人们可以在玩乐的同时学到东西。\n\n\n# simon s217 应该上大学还是应该直接找工作\n\nsome people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nwhen they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. while there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, i would argue that it is better to go to college or university.\n\n当青少年完成学业时，他们面临着是找工作还是继续深造的困境。尽管刚从学校毕业后直接找工作有一些好处，但我认为上大学或大专更好。\n\nthe option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. in this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. in terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. they will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. this may lead to promotions and a successful career.\n\n直接在学校毕业后开始工作的选项因几个原因而具有吸引力。许多年轻人希望尽快开始挣钱。通过这种方式，他们可以变得独立，并将能够负担得起自己的房子或开始组建家庭。就职业而言，选择找工作而不是继续学业的年轻人可能会更快进步。他们将有机会获得真实经验并学习与所选职业相关的实用技能。这可能会带来晋升和成功的职业生涯。\n\non the other hand, i believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. for example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher, or lawyer without having the relevant degree. as a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.\n\n另一方面，我认为学生继续学习更有益。首先，许多职业需要学术资格。例如，没有相关学位就不可能成为医生、教师或律师。因此，大学毕业生可以获得更多更好的工作机会，他们的薪水通常也比那些学历较低的人高。其次，就业市场竞争越来越激烈，有时一家公司的一个职位可能有数百名申请者。没有大学或学院学历的年轻人将无法竞争。\n\nfor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.\n\n基于上述原因，我认为如果学生在学校层次之外继续学习，他们在职业生涯中更有可能取得成功。\n\n\n# simon s218 政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言\n\nseveral languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. discuss both these views and give your opinion.\n\nit is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, i believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.\n\n确实，一些少数民族语言可能在不久的将来消失。尽管可以认为，政府通过允许这种情况发生可以节省资金，但我认为应该保护和保存这些语言。\n\nthere are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers, and marketing. this money might be better spent on other public services. secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.\n\n保存少数民族语言可能被视为浪费资金有几个原因。首先，如果一种语言只有少数人说，将需要昂贵的教育计划以确保更多人学习它，而国家将不得不支付设施、教师和市场营销的费用。这些钱可能更应该用于其他公共服务。其次，对于国家来说，只有一种语言会更便宜且更高效。政府可以削减与每个少数群体沟通相关的各种成本。\n\ndespite the above arguments, i believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. a language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. if a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. by spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs, and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.\n\n尽管有上述论点，我认为政府应该努力保存较少使用的语言。语言不仅仅是交流的工具；它与说这种语言的人的文化身份有着重要的联系。如果一种语言消失，一整种生活方式也会随之消失，我们将失去使社会更有趣的丰富文化多样性。通过花钱保护少数民族语言，政府还可以保存构成国家历史的传统、习俗和行为。\n\nin conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term, this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.\n\n总之，如果我们允许少数民族语言消失，短期内可能会节省资金，但从长远来看，这将对我们的文化遗产产生极其负面的影响。\n\n\n# simon s219 环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么\n\nexplain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment. what can governments do to address these problems? what can individual people do?\n\nhumans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet. this essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.\n\n人类对许多环境问题负有责任，但我们也可以采取措施减少我们对地球的破坏。本文将讨论环境问题以及政府和个人可以采取的措施。\n\ntwo of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. as the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.\n\n环境面临的两大威胁是空气污染和废物。工厂的气体排放和车辆的尾气排放导致全球变暖，这可能在未来对地球产生毁灭性的影响。随着人口的增加，我们也在产生越来越多的废物，这些废物污染了土地并且污染了河流和海洋。\n\ngovernments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. they could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. they could also impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. in this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.\n\n政府当然可以采取更多措施来减少空气污染。他们可以制定法律限制工厂排放，或强制公司使用来自太阳能、风能或水能的可再生能源。他们还可以对驾驶者和航空公司征收“绿色税”。通过这种方式，人们将被鼓励使用公共交通并减少出国航班，从而减少排放。\n\nindividuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. they can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for recycling glass, plastic, and paper in their car parks. by reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.\n\n个人也应对他们对环境的影响负责。他们可以乘坐公共交通工具而不是驾车，选择包装较少的产品，并尽可能多地回收。现在大多数超市为购物者提供可重复使用的袋子，并在停车场设有回收玻璃、塑料和纸张的“回收站”。通过重复使用和回收，我们可以帮助减少废物。\n\nin conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.\n\n总之，国家政府和个人都必须在照顾环境方面发挥作用。\n\n\n# simon s220 为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福\n\nhappiness is considered very important in life. why is it difficult to define? what factors are important in achieving happiness?\n\nit is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. while the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.\n\n毫无疑问，大多数人希望在他们的生活中感到快乐。虽然快乐的个人本质使得它难以描述，但似乎确实存在一些我们都共有的关于体验或实现快乐的共同需求。\n\nhappiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take pleasure. some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are much more important. at the same time, a range of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.\n\n快乐难以定义，因为对每个人来说意味着不同的事情。没有人能完全理解或体验另一个人的感受，我们都有自己特定的激情，从中获取快乐。例如，有些人从赚钱或取得成功中获得满足感，而对其他人来说，健康和家庭更为重要。同时，从兴奋到平和的一系列其他感受可能与快乐的概念相关联，因此同一个人可能会以多种不同的方式感到快乐。\n\nalthough it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving it. firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. our basic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasant life. secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. other key factors could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life.\n\n尽管给快乐下一个准确的定义似乎几乎不可能，但大多数人会同意实现快乐有一些基本前提条件。首先，如果一个人没有安全的居住环境和足够的食物，他或她很难感到快乐。我们的基本生存需求必须首先得到满足，之后我们才能过上愉快的生活。其次，生活中最大的快乐通常来自与家人和朋友的共同经历，很少有人满足于完全孤立地生活。其他关键因素可能是个人自由和生活的目标感。\n\nin conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each individual, but i believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.\n\n总之，快乐难以定义，因为它对每个人都是特定的，但我相信我们在体验快乐之前需要满足住所、食物和陪伴的基本需求。\n\n\n# simon s221 你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源\n\nwild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nsome people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. i completely disagree with this point of view.\n\nin my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21stcentury. i do not believe that planet earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. we do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world’s population. there is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.\n\ni also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. it is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. for example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the earth’s climate. if we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. by protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on earth.\n\nin conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and i believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.\n\n\n# simon s222 严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗\n\nsome people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. in my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.\n\non the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. there are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. the aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. as a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.\n\non the other hand, i believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that donot punish drivers. firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. for example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.\n\nin conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, i believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.\n\n\n# simon s223 企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任\n\nas well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nbusinesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. i completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.\n\non the one hand, i accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. it seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. on top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. if a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. in other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.\n\non the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. one social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. for example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. i also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, i believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.\n\nin conclusion, i believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.\n\n\n# simon s224 政府如何让城市生活更美好\n\nmore and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. how can governments make urban life better for everyone?\n\ncities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. in my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.\n\nthe main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. as a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.\n\nhowever, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. in london, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. a third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.\n\nin conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.\n\n\n# simon s225 现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢\n\nin some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. do you think this is a positive or negative development?\n\nin recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. in my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.\n\nthe rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. on an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. a young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. from an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. this is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.\n\nhowever, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. they miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. while this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.\n\nin conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.\n\n\n# simon s226 大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的\n\nsome people think that all university students should study whatever they like. others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. while some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, i believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.\n\nthere are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. they may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. from a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. on the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.\n\nin spite of these arguments, i believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. in my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. if this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.\n\nin conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, i personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.\n\n\n# simon s227 让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪\n\nsome people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime. to what extent do you agree or disagree? it is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. i completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.\n\nin my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. they can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. while adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, i imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. the vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.\n\nthe alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. one option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. this could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. a second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but i doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.\n\nin conclusion, i fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.\n\n\n# simon s228 传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地\n\nthe older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. however, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?\n\nit is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. while i agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, i believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.\n\non the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. in the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. at the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. but perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. the traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.\n\non the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. for example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. in our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. finally, i believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.\n\nin conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/01/27

1. 原始社会的教育状况：\n    \n    在原始社会里，由于社会的生产水平很低，教育还是社会生活中分化成为专门的事业，没有专门的教育机构和专职教育人员。这一时期的教育多是在社会生产和社会生活的过程中进行的。\n\n 2. 古代学校教育：\n    \n    ①. 学校产生的历史条件\n    \n    学校教育在奴隶社会产生，是一定历史阶段的产物（生产力的发展导致），它的产生得益于一系列社会条件的满足，包括以下几个方面\n    \n    1. 社会生产水平的提高，为学校的产生提供必要的物质基础\n    2. 脑力劳动与体力劳动的分离，为学校产生提供了专门从事教育活动的知识分子，社会分工从单纯的生产劳动领域扩大到了整个社会，出现了体脑分工，作为广义文化重要组成部分之1的教育，也就逐渐演变成为一种专门和固定的职业\n    3. 文字的产生和知识的记载与整理达到了一定程度\n    4. 国家机器的产生需要专门的教育机构来培养官吏和知识分子\n    \n    ②. 古代学校教育形态的特征\n    \n    1. 奴隶社会和封建社会的学校教育，基本上是与生产劳动脱离的\n    2. 学校教育被奴隶主阶级和地主阶级所垄断，具有鲜明的阶级性\n    3. 学校成为了统治阶级培养统治人才的场所，以维持统治地位\n    4. 学校的教学内容主要是古人文科学和致人之术（中国更多的是重道法，轻科学）\n    5. 教育的组织形式是采用个别教学\n    6.

学校教育逐步普及，现代教育从初等教育，中等教育一直到高等教育，逐步普及，在一些先进发达国家，已实现了高等教育的大众化。义务教育的出现是现代教育的一个重大发展，它对社会的发展起到了不可估量的作用。\n\n 2. 教育的公共性日益突出，随着工业生产发展的需要工人阶级和其他劳动人民对教育权的争取加强。随着现在社会管理方式的变化，各国都强调保障人人享有受教育的权利，使得教育的公共性日益突出。\n    \n    这是现代教育的一个重要进步，但教育公平教育的阶层性，种族、性别歧视等远未清除\n\n 3. 教育的生产性不断增强，现代教育日益与生产劳动相结合，这促使现代教育成为劳动再生产的重要手段，也成为科学知识、再生产和发展科学技术的重要手段，对提高社会生产效率和增加社会财富起到重要的作用。教育改革因此被看作是经济发展的战略性条件。\n\n 4.

孔子的教育对象\n\n强调有教无类，不分贵贱，人人都可以受教育\n\n倡导教育公平，很先进的教育思想。\n\n 4. 学而优则仕 与教育目的\n\n\n\n**正面性：**可以为封建统治阶层提供新鲜血液，不让统治阶级固化，这对于西周的教育是降维打击，打破了世袭制，有利于社会发展。\n\n反面性：万般皆下品，惟有读书高。变相不利于社会的发展了\n\n 5. 教育内容：\n\n书      书名全称          注释\n《诗》    《诗经》          我国历史上第一部诗歌总集\n《书》    《书经》(即《尚书》    这是周王室外史所藏的政治文件，编年体\n《礼》    《仪礼》          礼仪，约束人的思想道德\n《易》    《易经》(即《周易》)   群经之首，中国哲学源头，思辨性很强\n《乐》    《乐经》          隶属周王室司乐的音乐作品\n《春秋》   《春秋》          记录历史，春秋是先秦对史书的通称\n\n教学内容的特点\n\n重社会人文，轻宗教\n\n重文，轻武\n\n轻科技、生产力相关，自然知识比较贫乏\n\n 6. 教学方法\n\n因材施教\n\n启发诱导，强调独立思考\n\n思行并重\n\n不耻下问，实事求是，态度好学\n\n 7. 道德\n\n仁礼：德育至上\n\n德育重在行办，强调克己\n\n 8. 论教师\n\n学而不厌，诲人不倦，教学相长\n\n 9. 历史影响\n\n已经有教育学原理中的\n\n * 原理\n * 功能目的\n * 内容\n * 方法\n * 德育\n\n# 02 孟轲——孔子最好的弟子\n\n> 孟子人称亚圣，继承孔子的仁学思想\n\n性善论\n\n强调人与动物的区别\n\n通过教育扩张人的善\n\n“明人伦”与教育目的\n\n培养人才为教育服务\n\n> 人伦：社会秩序\n\n深造“自”得——自己的领悟\n\n盈科而进：学好了再往前\n\n教亦多术：教人的方法有很多种\n\n专心致志：认真专心\n\n# 03 荀子——稷下学宫任职过\n\n1. 礼法并重\n\n> 法家思想在战国后期为秦国重用，并最终实现了大一统\n\n2. 性恶论\n\n先天都是自私的，伪善的，需要后天的努力学习来改变\n\n化性起伪\n\n3. 设定成就等级：\n\n大儒\n\n俗儒\n\n雅儒\n\n大儒是最理想的一类人才，知识广博，能以浅持搏，以古持今，以一持万\n\n4. 以儒家经典为讲课内容\n\n荀子重视儒家经典的传播，尤其是《礼》、《乐》\n\n5. “闻见知行”结合的学习过程\n\n孟子“内求”，荀子“外铄”\n\n> 孟子性善论，强调向内发掘人性的美好。\n> \n> 荀子性恶论，强调需要靠外力来改变人的恶。\n\n学与思的关系上，侧重于“学”\n\n学习的过程：\n\n闻见：外在的体会，感受\n\n知：理性认识，掌握内在规律\n\n行：实践，践行\n\n> 孔子是学——思——行\n\n学习方法：\n\n 1. 善假于物：善于是用外在事物，促进自己的发展\n 2. 兼陈中衡：在学习过程中如何保持平衡统一，类似孔子的中庸思想\n 3. 虚一而静：专心致志\n\n6. 论教师\n\n重视教师的作用和地位\n\n对教师也提出了非常严格的要求\n\n师生关系强调尊重，学生努力进步，勇于超过老师\n\n片面强调服从教师",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/02/12

表示的是一个无穷级数（也就是无穷个数的和）。具体来说，∑n=0∞an\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n∑n=0∞ an 表示的是a0+a1+a2+a3+…a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\ldotsa0 +a1 +a2 +a3 +…，即对所有的非负整数nnn，ana_nan 的总和。\n\n在这里，ana_nan 可以是任何依赖于nnn的表达式或函数。例如，∑n=0∞12n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}∑n=0∞ 2n1 就表示的是1+12+14+18+…1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\ldots1+21 +41 +81 +…，这是一个几何级数。\n\n要注意的是，无穷级数可能并不总是收敛的，也就是说，它们的和可能不是一个有限的数。对于无穷级数是否收敛，以及如果收敛，它们收敛于什么值，这是研究级数的重要问题。对于特定的无穷级数，有多种数学工具可以用来确定它们是否收敛，以及它们的和是多少。\n\n\n# 导数的概念\n\n在微积分中，导数的概念是用来衡量一个函数在某一点处的变化率。形象地说，对于实数函数，导数可以理解为函数图像在该点的切线的斜率。在函数y=f(x)y = f(x)y=f(x)中，导数是函数f(x)f(x)f(x)在某点xxx处的切线斜率，记为dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy 或f′(x)f\'(x)f′(x)。\n\n具体到dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy 这个符号，其含义可以这样理解：\n\n * "dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy "这个符号是由莱布尼茨创立的，其目的是强调导数是比率或斜率的概念。在物理学中，这种表达方式往往更直观，更能表达出微分学的几何或物理意义。\n * "ddd"的含义通常被理解为"微小的改变"，所以"dxdxdx"表示xxx的微小改变，"dydydy"表示yyy的微小改变。\n * "dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy "则表示当xxx发生微小改变时，yyy随之改变的程度，即函数f(x)f(x)f(x)在xxx处的变化率或斜率。\n\n所以，dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy 的意思是“yyy关于xxx的导数”。\n\n\n# 微分的用途\n\n微分学是数学的一个重要分支，它有着广泛的应用。下面是一些微分学的主要用途：\n\n 1. 寻找最值和解决优化问题：在经济学、物理学、工程学等许多领域，我们经常需要找出函数的最大值或最小值。微分学提供了一种方法，通过寻找函数的导数等于零的点，我们可以找出可能的最大值和最小值。\n\n 2. 建立模型并进行预测：在物理学中，微分方程经常被用于描述物理过程，例如牛顿第二定律就是一个微分方程。在生物学和经济学中，微分方程也常用于建立动态模型。然后通过解微分方程，我们可以对未来进行预测。\n\n 3. 理解并描述变化率：微分的基本概念是导数，表示的是函数在某一点的变化率。例如，物理中的速度就是位移关于时间的导数，加速度是速度关于时间的导数。\n\n 4. 在计算机图形学中的应用：微分被用于计算机图形学中的许多应用，如曲线和曲面的建模，材质的渲染等。\n\n 5. 在机器学习和人工智能中的应用：在机器学习和人工智能中，梯度下降等优化算法需要用到微分来更新参数并最小化损失函数。\n\n总的来说，微分学是许多科学、工程和数学问题的基础工具。\n\n\n# 微分公式解读\n\n在微积分中，符号"∣x=−1|_{x=-1}∣x=−1 "表示"在x=−1x=-1x=−1处"。因此，表达式"dy∣x=−1dy|_{x=-1}dy∣x=−1 "的意思是函数yyy关于xxx的微分在x=−1x=-1x=−1处的值。换句话说，它表示当x=−1x=-1x=−1时，yyy随xxx的微小改变而变化的量，也可以理解为函数y=f(x)y=f(x)y=f(x)在x=−1x=-1x=−1处的切线的斜率。\n\n\n# 微分运算法则\n\n以下是微积分中常用的一些求导法则：\n\n 1. 幂法则：如果 f(x)=xnf(x) = x^nf(x)=xn，那么 f′(x)=n⋅xn−1f\'(x) = n \\cdot x^{n-1}f′(x)=n⋅xn−1。\n\n 2. 常数法则：如果 f(x)=cf(x) = cf(x)=c，其中 ccc 是一个常数，那么 f′(x)=0f\'(x) = 0f′(x)=0。\n\n 3. 常数乘法法则：如果 f(x)=c⋅g(x)f(x) = c \\cdot g(x)f(x)=c⋅g(x)，其中 ccc 是一个常数，那么 f′(x)=c⋅g′(x)f\'(x) = c \\cdot g\'(x)f′(x)=c⋅g′(x)。\n\n 4. 和差法则：如果 f(x)=g(x)±h(x)f(x) = g(x) \\pm h(x)f(x)=g(x)±h(x)，那么 f′(x)=g′(x)±h′(x)f\'(x) = g\'(x) \\pm h\'(x)f′(x)=g′(x)±h′(x)。\n\n 5. 乘法法则（乘积法则）：如果 f(x)=g(x)⋅h(x)f(x) = g(x) \\cdot h(x)f(x)=g(x)⋅h(x)，那么 f′(x)=g′(x)⋅h(x)+g(x)⋅h′(x)f\'(x) = g\'(x) \\cdot h(x) + g(x) \\cdot h\'(x)f′(x)=g′(x)⋅h(x)+g(x)⋅h′(x)。\n\n 6. 除法法则（商法则）：如果 F(x)=g(x)f(x)F(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{f(x)}F(x)=f(x)g(x) ，那么 F′(x)=g′(x)⋅f(x)−g(x)⋅f′(x)(f(x))2F\'(x) = \\frac{g\'(x) \\cdot f(x) - g(x) \\cdot f\'(x)}{(f(x))^2}F′(x)=(f(x))2g′(x)⋅f(x)−g(x)⋅f′(x) 。\n\n 7. 链式法则：如果 f(x)=g(h(x))f(x) = g(h(x))f(x)=g(h(x))，那么 f′(x)=g′(h(x))⋅h′(x)f\'(x) = g\'(h(x)) \\cdot h\'(x)f′(x)=g′(h(x))⋅h′(x)。链式法则用于复合函数的导数。\n\n 8. 三角函数的导数：\n    \n    * ddxsin⁡(x)=cos⁡(x)\\frac{d}{dx}

∑n=0∞\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}∑n=0∞\n\n符号∑n=0∞\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}∑n=0∞ 表示的是一个无穷级数（也就是无穷个数的和）。具体来说，∑n=0∞an\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n∑n=0∞ an 表示的是a0+a1+a2+a3+…a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\ldotsa0 +a1 +a2 +a3 +…，即对所有的非负整数nnn，ana_nan 的总和。\n\n在这里，ana_nan 可以是任何依赖于nnn的表达式或函数。例如，∑n=0∞12n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}∑n=0∞ 2n1 就表示的是1+12+14+18+…1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\ldots1+21 +41 +81 +…，这是一个几何级数。\n\n要注意的是，无穷级数可能并不总是收敛的，也就是说，它们的和可能不是一个有限的数。对于无穷级数是否收敛，以及如果收敛，它们收敛于什么值，这是研究级数的重要问题。对于特定的无穷级数，有多种数学工具可以用来确定它们是否收敛，以及它们的和是多少。\n\n\n# 导数的概念\n\n在微积分中，导数的概念是用来衡量一个函数在某一点处的变化率。形象地说，对于实数函数，导数可以理解为函数图像在该点的切线的斜率。在函数y=f(x)y = f(x)y=f(x)中，导数是函数f(x)f(x)f(x)在某点xxx处的切线斜率，记为dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy 或f′(x)f\'(x)f′(x)。\n\n具体到dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy 这个符号，其含义可以这样理解：\n\n * "dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy "这个符号是由莱布尼茨创立的，其目的是强调导数是比率或斜率的概念。在物理学中，这种表达方式往往更直观，更能表达出微分学的几何或物理意义。\n * "ddd"的含义通常被理解为"微小的改变"，所以"dxdxdx"表示xxx的微小改变，"dydydy"表示yyy的微小改变。\n * "dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy "则表示当xxx发生微小改变时，yyy随之改变的程度，即函数f(x)f(x)f(x)在xxx处的变化率或斜率。\n\n所以，dydx\\frac{dy}{dx}dxdy 的意思是“yyy关于xxx的导数”。\n\n\n# 微分的用途\n\n微分学是数学的一个重要分支，它有着广泛的应用。下面是一些微分学的主要用途：\n\n 1. 寻找最值和解决优化问题：在经济学、物理学、工程学等许多领域，我们经常需要找出函数的最大值或最小值。微分学提供了一种方法，通过寻找函数的导数等于零的点，我们可以找出可能的最大值和最小值。\n\n 2. 建立模型并进行预测：在物理学中，微分方程经常被用于描述物理过程，例如牛顿第二定律就是一个微分方程。在生物学和经济学中，微分方程也常用于建立动态模型。然后通过解微分方程，我们可以对未来进行预测。\n\n 3. 理解并描述变化率：微分的基本概念是导数，表示的是函数在某一点的变化率。例如，物理中的速度就是位移关于时间的导数，加速度是速度关于时间的导数。\n\n 4. 在计算机图形学中的应用：微分被用于计算机图形学中的许多应用，如曲线和曲面的建模，材质的渲染等。\n\n 5. 在机器学习和人工智能中的应用：在机器学习和人工智能中，梯度下降等优化算法需要用到微分来更新参数并最小化损失函数。\n\n总的来说，微分学是许多科学、工程和数学问题的基础工具。\n\n\n# 微分公式解读\n\n在微积分中，符号"∣x=−1|_{x=-1}∣x=−1 "表示"在x=−1x=-1x=−1处"。因此，表达式"dy∣x=−1dy|_{x=-1}dy∣x=−1 "的意思是函数yyy关于xxx的微分在x=−1x=-1x=−1处的值。换句话说，它表示当x=−1x=-1x=−1时，yyy随xxx的微小改变而变化的量，也可以理解为函数y=f(x)y=f(x)y=f(x)在x=−1x=-1x=−1处的切线的斜率。\n\n\n# 微分运算法则\n\n以下是微积分中常用的一些求导法则：\n\n 1. 幂法则：如果 f(x)=xnf(x) = x^nf(x)=xn，那么 f′(x)=n⋅xn−1f\'(x) = n \\cdot x^{n-1}f′(x)=n⋅xn−1。\n\n 2. 常数法则：如果 f(x)=cf(x) = cf(x)=c，其中 ccc 是一个常数，那么 f′(x)=0f\'(x) = 0f′(x)=0。\n\n 3. 常数乘法法则：如果 f(x)=c⋅g(x)f(x) = c \\cdot g(x)f(x)=c⋅g(x)，其中 ccc 是一个常数，那么 f′(x)=c⋅g′(x)f\'(x) = c \\cdot g\'(x)f′(x)=c⋅g′(x)。\n\n 4. 和差法则：如果 f(x)=g(x)±h(x)f(x) = g(x) \\pm h(x)f(x)=g(x)±h(x)，那么 f′(x)=g′(x)±h′(x)f\'(x) = g\'(x) \\pm h\'(x)f′(x)=g′(x)±h′(x)。\n\n 5. 乘法法则（乘积法则）：如果 f(x)=g(x)⋅h(x)f(x) = g(x) \\cdot h(x)f(x)=g(x)⋅h(x)，那么 f′(x)=g′(x)⋅h(x)+g(x)⋅h′(x)f\'(x) = g\'(x) \\cdot h(x) + g(x) \\cdot h\'(x)f′(x)=g′(x)⋅h(x)+g(x)⋅h′(x)。\n\n 6. 除法法则（商法则）：如果 f(x)=g(x)f(x)f(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{f(x)}f(x)=f(x)g(x) ，那么 f′(x)=g′(x)⋅f(x)−g(x)⋅f′(x)(f(x))2f\'(x) = \\frac{g\'(x) \\cdot f(x) - g(x) \\cdot f\'(x)}{(f(x))^2}f′(x)=(f(x))2g′(x)⋅f(x)−g(x)⋅f′(x) 。\n\n 7. 链式法则：如果 f(x)=g(h(x))f(x) = g(h(x))f(x)=g(h(x))，那么 f′(x)=g′(h(x))⋅h′(x)f\'(x) = g\'(h(x)) \\cdot h\'(x)f′(x)=g′(h(x))⋅h′(x)。链式法则用于复合函数的导数。\n\n 8. 三角函数的导数：\n    \n    * ddxsin⁡(x)=cos⁡(x)\\frac{d}{dx}

Theorem）来进行证明。\n\n首先，我们需要证明方程在区间上连续。我们知道，多项式函数是连续的，因此 f(x)=x5−3x−1f(x) = x^5 - 3x - 1f(x)=x5−3x−1 在整个实数域上都是连续的。\n\n接下来，我们需要证明在区间的两个端点上函数值的符号不同。计算 f(1)f(1)f(1) 和 f(2)f(2)f(2) 的值：\n\nf(1)=15−3(1)−1=−3f(1) = 1^5 - 3(1) - 1 = -3f(1)=15−3(1)−1=−3\n\nf(2)=25−3(2)−1=25f(2) = 2^5 - 3(2) - 1 = 25f(2)=25−3(2)−1=25\n\n我们可以看到 f(1)f(1)f(1) 是负数，而 f(2)f(2)f(2) 是正数，即 f(1)<0<f(2)f(1) < 0 < f(2)f(1)<0<f(2)。\n\n根据介值定理，如果一个连续函数在一个区间的两个端点处取不同的符号，那么在这个区间内一定存在至少一个实根。在我们的情况下，由于 f(1)<0<f(2)f(1) < 0 < f(2)f(1)<0<f(2)，因此方程 x5−3x−1=0x^5 - 3x - 1 = 0x5−3x−1=0 在区间 (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2)

f'(u)dudf =f′(u)，dgdx=2x\\frac{dg}{dx} = 2xdxdg =2x。\n\n应用链式法则，我们有：\n\ndydx=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)=f′(x2)⋅2x\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = f'(x^2) \\cdot 2xdxdy =f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)=f′(x2)⋅2x。\n\n特别地，在x=−1x=-1x=−1处，有：\n\ndy∣x=−1=f′(1)⋅2(−1)=0.5⋅−2=−1dy|_{x=-1} = f'(1) \\cdot 2(-1) = 0.5 \\cdot -2 = -1dy∣x=−1

f(t)dt，那么dFdx=f(b(x))⋅b′(x)−f(a(x))⋅a′(x)\\frac{dF}{dx} = f(b(x))\\cdot b'(x) - f(a(x))\\cdot a'(x)dxdF =f(b(x))⋅b′(x)−f(a(x))⋅a′(x)。\n\n在这个问题中，我们让f(t)=sin⁡tf(t) = \\sin tf(t)=sint，a(x)=0a(x) = 0a(x)=0，b(x)=x2b(x) = x^2b(x)=x2。所以a′(x)=0a'(x) = 0a′(x)=0，b′(x)=2xb'(x) = 2xb′(x)=2x。\n\n使用莱布尼茨公式，我们有：\n\nddx∫0x2sin⁡tdt=sin⁡(x2)⋅2x−sin⁡(0)⋅0=2xsin⁡(x2)\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_{0}^{x^2} \\sin tdt =

对于一个定义在区间[a,b][a, b][a,b]的函数f(x)f(x)f(x)，如果我们将区间[a,b][a, b][a,b]划分为nnn个等宽的小区间，每个小区间的长度为Δx=(b−a)/n\\Delta x = (b - a) / nΔx=(b−a)/n。然后在第iii个小区间[a+(i−1)Δx,a+iΔx][a + (i-1) \\Delta x, a + i \\Delta x][a+(i−1)Δx,a+iΔx]中选择一个点xix_ixi ，黎曼和就定义为：\n> \n> S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\Delta x$$。 我们可以看到，每一项$f(x_i) \\Delta x$都对应着第$i$个小区间上的一个矩形的面积，而$S$就是这些矩形面积的总和。当$n$趋向于无穷大时，也就是小区间的宽度趋向于0时，如果这个极限存在，那么黎曼和$S$就会趋近于函数$f(x)$在区间$[a, b]$上的定积分的值，这就是黎曼积分的定义。\n\n其中f(x)=11+x/nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + x/n}}f(x)=1+x/n 1

\\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h} + \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x)}{h} (f(x)g(x))′=h→0lim hf(x+h)g(x+h)−f(x)g(x+h) +h→0lim hf(x)g(x+h)−f(x)g(x)\n\n我们可以在每个极限中分离变量 fff 和 ggg：\n\n(f(x)g(x))′=g(x+h)lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)h+f(x)lim⁡h→0g(x+h)−g(x)h(f(x)g(x))' = g(x+h) \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} + f(x) \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} (f(x)g(x))′=g(x+h)h→0lim hf(x+h)−f(x) +f(x)h→0lim hg(x+h)−g(x)\n\n由导数的定义，我们知道\n\nf′(x)=lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)hf'(x) = \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} f′(x)=h→0lim hf(x+h)−f(x)\n\n以及\n\ng′(x)=lim⁡h→0g(x+h)−g(x)hg'(x) = \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} g′(x)=h→0lim hg(x+h)−g(x)\n\n最后，我们得到\n\n(f(x)g(x))′=g(x)f′(x)+f(x)g′(x)(f(x)g(x))' = g(x)f'(x) + f(x)g'(x) (f(x)g(x))′=g(x)f′(x)+f(x)g′(x)\n\n这就证明了乘法法则 (f(x)g(x))′=f′(x)g(x)+f(x)g′(x)(f(x)g(x))' = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)(f(x)g(x))′=f′(x)g(x)+f(x)g′(x)。\n\n这个证明假设了 f(x)f(x)f(x) 和 g(x)g(x)g(x) 都是可导的，并且它们的导数在 xxx 点处是连续的。如果这些条件不满足，乘法法则可能不成立。\n\n\n# 计算题\n\n\n# 1\n\n$\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{tan(x2-1)}{x3-1} $\n\n这是一个0/00/00/0型的极限，可以使用洛必达法则进行求解。洛必达法则是指：如果一个极限是0/0型或者∞/∞型，那么这个极限的值等于函数分子和分母的导数的极限。\n\n首先，求解分子$$tan(x^2-1)$$和分母x3−1x^3-1x3−1的导数：\n\n * tan(x2−1)tan(x^2-1)tan(x2−1) 的导数为sec2(x2−1)∗2xsec^2(x^2-1) * 2xsec2(x2−1)∗2x\n   \n   > 涉及到了链式法则对于复合函数y=f(g(x))，其导数dy/dx=f′(g(x))∗g′(x)，这就是链式法则。对于复合函数y = f(g(x))，其导数dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)，这就是链式法则。对于复合函数y=f(g(x))，其导数dy/dx=f′(g(x))∗g′(x)，这就是链式法则。\n   > \n   > dydx=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)=sec⁡2(x2−1)⋅2x\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = \\sec^2(x^2 - 1) \\cdot 2xdxdy =f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)=sec2(x2−1)⋅2x。\n\n * $x^3-1 的导数为的导数为的导数为 3x^2$\n\n所以原式可以转化为：\n\nlim⁡x→1sec2(x2−1)∗2x3x2\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{sec^2(x^2-1) * 2x}{3x^2}limx→1 3x2sec2(x2−1)∗2x\n\n带入x=1：\n\nlim⁡x→1sec2(0)∗23=23\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{sec^2(0) * 2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}limx→1 3sec2(0)∗2 =32\n\n因此，lim⁡x→1tan(x2−1)x3−1=23。\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{tan(x^2-1)}{x^3-1} = \\frac{2}{3}。limx→1 x3−1tan(x2−1) =32 。\n\n\n# 2\n\n设函数f(u)可导且f′(1)=0.5，则y=f(x2)在x=−1处的微分dy∣x=−1=设函数f(u)可导且f'(1)=0.5，则y=f(x^2)在x=-1处的微分dy|_{x=-1}=设函数f(u)可导且f′(1)=0.5，则y=f(x2)在x=−1处的微分dy∣x=−1 =\n\n这个问题涉及到链式法则，它是微积分中的一种导数运算规则，用于求解复合函数的导数。在这个问题中，我们的外层函数是f(u)f(u)f(u)，内层函数是x2x^2x2。我们知道f(u)f(u)f(u)在u=1u=1u=1处的导数f′(1)=0.5f'(1)=0.5f′(1)=0.5。\n\n链式法则可以表示为：对于复合函数y=f(g(x))y = f(g(x))y=f(g(x))，其导数dydx=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)dxdy =f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)。\n\n在这个问题中，我们让f(u)=f(u)f(u) = f(u)f(u)=f(u)，g(x)=x2g(x) = x^2g(x)=x2。于是，dfdu=f′(u)\\frac{df}{du} = f'(u)dudf =f′(u)，dgdx=2x\\frac{dg}{dx} = 2xdxdg =2x。\n\n应用链式法则，我们有：\n\ndydx=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)=f′(x2)⋅2x\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = f'(x^2) \\cdot 2xdxdy =f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)=f′(x2)⋅2x。\n\n特别地，在x=−1x=-1x=−1处，有：\n\ndy∣x=−1=f′(1)⋅2(−1)=0.5⋅−2=−1dy|_{x=-1} = f'(1) \\cdot 2(-1) = 0.5 \\cdot -2 = -1dy∣x=−1 =f′(1)⋅2(−1)=0.5⋅−2=−1。\n\n所以，y=f(x2)y=f(x^2)y=f(x2)在x=−1x=-1x=−1处的微分dy∣x=−1=−1dy|_{x=-1}=-1dy∣x=−1 =−1。\n\n\n# 3\n\nddx∫0x2sintdt=\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{0}^{x^2} sintdt=dxd ∫0x2 sintdt=\n\n这个问题要用到微积分中的莱布尼茨公式，即对积分的上限或下限求导的公式。莱布尼茨公式如下：\n\n如果f(x)f(x)f(x)是一个从a(x)a(x)a(x)到b(x)b(x)b(x)的定积分，即f(x)=∫a(x)b(x)f(t)dtf(x) = \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(t)dtf(x)=∫a(x)b(x) f(t)dt，那么dfdx=f(b(x))⋅b′(x)−f(a(x))⋅a′(x)\\frac{df}{dx} = f(b(x))\\cdot b'(x) - f(a(x))\\cdot a'(x)dxdf =f(b(x))⋅b′(x)−f(a(x))⋅a′(x)。\n\n在这个问题中，我们让f(t)=sin⁡tf(t) = \\sin tf(t)=sint，a(x)=0a(x) = 0a(x)=0，b(x)=x2b(x) = x^2b(x)=x2。所以a′(x)=0a'(x) = 0a′(x)=0，b′(x)=2xb'(x) = 2xb′(x)=2x。\n\n使用莱布尼茨公式，我们有：\n\nddx∫0x2sin⁡tdt=sin⁡(x2)⋅2x−sin⁡(0)⋅0=2xsin⁡(x2)\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_{0}^{x^2} \\sin tdt = \\sin(x^2) \\cdot 2x - \\sin(0) \\cdot 0 = 2x\\sin(x^2)dxd ∫0x2 sintdt=sin(x2)⋅2x−sin(0)⋅0=2xsin(x2)。\n\n所以，ddx∫x20sin⁡tdt=−2xsin⁡(x2)\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{x^2}^{0} \\sin tdt = -2x\\sin(x^2)dxd ∫x20 sintdt=−2xsin(x2)。\n\n> 所以这里可以理解为把积分求导时所需要的转换是吧\n\n\n# 4\n\n 设 a 是常数,则当函数 f(x)=asin⁡x+13sin⁡3x 在 x=π3 处取得极值时,必有 a=\\text { 设 } a \\text { 是常数,则当函数 } f(x)=a \\sin x+\\frac{1}{3} \\sin 3 x \\text { 在 }

3xf(x)=asinx+31 sin3x的导数：\n\nf′(x)=acos⁡x+cos⁡3xf'(x) = a \\cos x + \\cos 3xf′(x)=acosx+cos3x。\n\n将x=π3x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}x=3π 代入上式，我们得到\n\nf′(π3)=acos⁡(π3)+cos⁡(3⋅π3)=a⋅12−1=0f'(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = a \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) + \\cos(3 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = a \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = 0f′(3π )=acos(3π )+cos(3⋅3π )=a⋅21 −1=0，因为cos⁡(π3)=12\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}cos(3π )=21 ，cos⁡(π)=−1\\cos(\\pi) = -1cos(π)=−1。\n\n解出上式我们得到a=2a = 2a=2。因此，当函数f(x)f(x)f(x)在x=π3x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}x=3π 处取得极值时，必有a=2a = 2a=2。\n\n> 知识点补充：cos⁡(π3)=?\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3})=?cos(3π )=?\n> \n> 这是因为cos⁡(π3)\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3})cos(3π )的值在单位圆中定义。单位圆是一个半径为1的圆，其中心位于坐标系的原点。在单位圆中，角度π3\\frac{\\pi}{3}3π （或60度）对应的余弦值（即x坐标值）是12\\frac{1}{2}21 或0.5。\n> \n> 在更直观的三角形中，我们也可以看到这一点：如果你画一个等边三角形，然后画一个角为60度（π3\\frac{\\pi}{3}3π 弧度）的角，那么相邻边（也就是余弦对应的边）长度的一半就是整个等边三角形边长的一半，所以cos⁡(π3)=0.5\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3})=0.5cos(3π )=0.5\n> \n> 所以，cos⁡(π3)=0.5\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3})=0.5cos(3π )=0.5是由三角函数的定义和性质决定的。\n\n\n# 5\n\nlim⁡n→∞(1n2+1+1n2+2+…+1n2+n)\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}

sum）。在这个问题中，我们先注意到分母中的n2n^2n2很大，所以可以对每一项都除以nnn，并且注意到这就是黎曼和的形式。\n\n> 黎曼和是一种用于近似定积分的数学工具，它是由德国数学家伯纳德·黎曼引入的。黎曼和的定义基于将一个给定区间分成许多小区间，并在每个小区间上选择一个点，然后用这些点的函数值与对应小区间长度的乘积之和来近似原函数在给定区间上的积分。\n> \n> 对于一个定义在区间[a,b][a, b][a,b]的函数f(x)f(x)f(x)，如果我们将区间[a,b][a, b][a,b]划分为nnn个等宽的小区间，每个小区间的长度为δx=(b−a)/n\\delta x = (b - a) / nδx=(b−a)/n。然后在第iii个小区间[a+(i−1)δx,a+iδx][a + (i-1) \\delta x, a + i \\delta x][a+(i−1)δx,a+iδx]中选择一个点xix_ixi ，黎曼和就定义为：\n> \n> s = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\delta x$$。 我们可以看到，每一项$f(x_i) \\delta x$都对应着第$i$个小区间上的一个矩形的面积，而$s$就是这些矩形面积的总和。当$n$趋向于无穷大时，也就是小区间的宽度趋向于0时，如果这个极限存在，那么黎曼和$s$就会趋近于函数$f(x)$在区间$[a, b]$上的定积分的值，这就是黎曼积分的定义。\n\n其中f(x)=11+x/nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + x/n}}f(x)=1+x/n 1 ，区间为[0,1][0,1][0,1]，划分为nnn个小区间。所以\n\nlim⁡n→∞(1n2+1+1n2+2+…+1n2+n)=lim⁡n→∞(1n∑i=1n11+i/n).\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}

u−1/2+1，即2u1/22u^{1/2}2u1/2。这是一个不定积分的结果，为了得到定积分的结果，我们需要在积分的界限处计算这个结果，也就是计算2u1/22u^{1/2}2u1/2在u=1u=1u=1和u=2u=2u=2处的结果，然后做差。所以，\n> \n> ∫12u−1/2du=[2u1/2]12=22−2.\\int_1^2 u^{-1/2} du = [2u^{1/2}]_1^2 =

前言\n\n在职求职跳槽和应届生求职区别很大。刚毕业的时候，根据对应学历找工作，就是从零开始，各大资本方对于这类人群，工资都是预设好的，没有浮动空间的。但随着工作年限的增加，工作经验的增加，劳动者在劳动力市场的价值其实已经获得了无形的增长。一个明显的变化就是，应届生刚参加工作，人们的宽容性通常会很高，工作内容更多的是打杂，但随着工作年限增加，开始接触核心工作内容，资本的要求也会变严格，工作后的履历过往，配合学历，成为资本选择的一大要素。\n\n这个时候，跳槽简历就是这些重要信息的承载体，是劳动者在资本眼中的第一印象。我们要认识到找工作的本质是与资本的博弈，是残酷的，容不得一丝幻想的，而简历是当前社会形势下最基本的，要是简历都没做好，岂不是吃饭不带碗。\n\n提示\n\n劳动者在这个过程中逐渐融入资本的发展环境之中，通过付出自身的劳动力与资本达成协议，换取收入。这里再往下深入就是资本论的原理内容了，挖个跳转链接的(坑)，说不定哪天就会更新了。\n\n\n总之，一定要记住的是，除非自己是公司所有者，掌握着生产资料，雇佣方(即资本)和劳动者之间，是存在根本的矛盾冲突的，且是不可完全调和的，原因简单来讲就是利益，资本家和无产者的利益导向不同，驱使着一切。资本家想要的是资本的无限增殖，是剥削更多的剩余价值(给最低的工资，干最累的活)；无产者想要的则是更高的收入，获得维持日常生活所必须的生活资料，并寻求提高生活质量。\n\n\n以上所说的并不是危言耸听，利益的根本不同会最终导致资本家与无产者之间存在无法调和的根本矛盾，这是不以人的意志为转移的客观规律。\n\n本篇就是跳槽简历的要点，大纲如下：\n\n

1. 简历的种类\n\n求职的人，分三种：应届毕业生，失业后求职的人，在职跳槽的人。\n\n应届生，自然就是即将进入社会的人，他们需要先找份工作，这才能正式进入社会。看下历年的应届生毕业人数，2021年有909万进入社会，2022年数据刚出来是1076万。这是巨大的就业压力，还不包括大学以下学历的毕业生、未就业的往届生、海龟生、考研考公那种“二战”失败的人。总的来说，应届生每年有大致1200万进入职场来求职。\n\n\n\n每年市场均需消化如此巨大的劳动力，如果任由自由经济市场主导，其无序性、自发性、盲动性乃至投机性可能会酿成重大的社会危机，在残酷的竞争下数以百万计的高校毕业生无法找到合适的工作，成为社会上的闲散人员，将有可能导致很大的社会问题。因此应届生就业是会带有国家政策导向的，而后随着应届生投入工作，开始成为劳动人民的一员后，从大数定律上来说，失业也开始了。导致失业的原因有很多，这里不做具体分析，但失业后的人，大多在会再找工作，这些人在哪？看下你身边不上班的人，除了少数已经实现所谓财务自由，大多数人还是要找工作的，也正在找工作中，他们时非在职状态的求职者。这个群体包括冒然裸辞的人、短期失业的人、单位转产破产失去工作的人、被裁员工、创业失败重找工作的人、全职太太重返职场，等等。\n\n保守估算下，总人口14亿中适龄劳动力人口有一半，这7亿按照官方经常公布的“失业率3-5%”的最低比例来计，7亿的3%，失业后的求职者大概2千万人。\n\n将应届生与这类失业人群加起来，保守估计3000万，虽然没有在职的人多，但因为他们时刻在投简历求职，所以，在求职者中占比还是很高的。这里就可以理解，为何你的简历投出去杳无音信，为何一个职位有成百上千个人投递了。\n\n综上，简历当然是按照人来分的：应届生的简历，失业人员的简历，跳槽人士的简历。三者自然各有侧重，也各有特点，我们今天要讲的就是，跳槽人士的简历如何制作。当然，如果你不是在职跳槽，也可以继续往下看，毕竟理念和方法都有想通的地方，另外，你也可以等我后续的“应届生简历如何制作？”“失业人员简历如何写？”比较下，才加强印象，这是最高效的学习。\n\n\n# 2. 简历的形式\n\n简历就是一个形式，能代表你这个劳动力即可，它需要根据具体情况用恰当的方式来体现，实际上并不拘泥于某一固定的形式，简历也并不仅仅是那几张纸。\n\n你目前还年轻，你不知道未来还有很多地方要你做简历：你表现好单位要提升你做主管时，要你做一份简历给人事部门；你报考在职硕士、博士等更高学位，学校会让你提供一份简历；你做生意，加盟还是合伙，总部和合伙人都要你提供简历；你的孩子读小学、初中、高中等等，你都要给孩子做简历，还要附上孩子父母也就是你们夫妻俩的简历......\n\n最简单的简历，就是一次闲聊，一场亲友聚会中你的表现。那边正好有个岗位空缺，熟人或者熟人的熟人觉得你比较合适，直接就可以上岗了，你的言谈举止，就是一份简历。这不但是最简单的简历，也是最牛掰的简历。大家不要过分拘泥于简历的形式，我们常说的“我要感谢自己职场上的贵人”，这个“贵人”识人时，大多不看简历，而是看言行举止，通过聊天去面试人。\n\n诸葛亮“隆中对”时秀给刘皇叔的三分天下之霸业理论，就是在秀自己的才华和谋略，还有口才，这就是最恰到好处的简历。引申到现在，行业口碑、业内名号、成就业绩等等，包括你的言谈举止和平时的为人作风，都是你的简历。时至今日，大老板们也更喜欢平时通过这种方式，去猎得自己需要的资深职员、主管、经理、总监、副总等人才。\n\n当然，我们更多的人，则是通过陌生面试来取得新工作。这里，在职人士的优势就来了，相比较于另两类求职者（应届生、待业失业人员）而言，我们在职，我们有名片。纸质名片、电子名片，都是名片，这就是最好的简历。如果你通过名片找到了好工作，这就是你牛逼的地方。\n\n圈内好友聚会，同学聚餐，行业交流会，群友聚会，等等，是我们分发名片的好时机，别小看了它们，好的工作机会就潜伏于好友朋友圈的聚会之时。大道至简，极简模式的简历，就是一张名片，彼此都很放松并信任的时候，名片就是最好的简历。\n\n有人说“我毫无职场关系”，那就只能通过猎头介绍、同学内推、网络投递等等方式去求职了。用这种陌生面试的方法去找工作时，传统意义上的那几张纸的简历，才发挥了作用。\n\n可以说，排除了职场关系后的求职，那几页A4纸打印的简历，就是当下最实用的简历。\n\n除此之外，你还可以制作PPT简历，来一段视频简介，甚至通过自己的网站等等来展示自己，这些都是硬简历的附属简历形式，可以根据具体情况来“出牌”。\n\n什么山上唱什么歌，比如我，参加年轻人的聚会，我可以送他她们几本自己签名的书；跟作家和文化圈子的人聚会，我秀下自媒体的文章和公众号头条号知乎号；跟老外相处我带他体会下中国文化，讲下中国历史；我去面试，这些就都不能讲了，也派不上用场，容易适得其反，我得秀我的职业履历......\n\n有如此多的简历形式，总体来看，“名片+A4简历”的形式，是最适合我们在职跳槽人士的。\n\n\n# 3. 如何选一个好的简历模板？\n\n简历就是你自己，尤其是针对经验丰富的职场人士。当我们去某宝或者微店搜索，能看到很多“简历制作”“简历修改”“简历优化”服务，单价从1块到3000元不等。但他们只能帮你美化简历上的字体、图片、布局，却不能帮你修改简历上的内容，连你原来简历中的错别字，也不敢修改。你别被“优化”“修改”字眼欺骗了，所以，简历必须得自己做。\n\n我今天就是来教你，如何对自己的简历来做大刀阔虎的改变，来一次简历大整容，而不仅仅是美容。\n\n大家注意下，网络投递简历时，每家人才招聘网站，都有自己的简历模板，往里面填写即可。但在猎头、亲友、熟人内推问我们要简历时，在我们去参加现场面试之时，是要带着一份打印好的简历过去的，这就是我们今天要讲的真正的简历。\n\n大家可以通过各种渠道搜寻简历模板，挑选2份自己最喜欢的简历模板。都是职场人士，都准备跳槽了，常联系的猎头总有几个吧？问他们各要几个简历模板，比方说有5份你喜欢。\n\n接着，你喜欢的，不一定是最好的，群众的眼睛才是雪亮的。所以，这5份简历，你分别展示给自己的好友看看，请他们打分。最终得票最高的那份，才是相对来说最好的简历模板。整理一下，将自己的信息录入，打印下来，放一份在身上，平时看看，有面试电话过来时，更可以拿出来跟对方交流，以免突然卡壳。每次面试时，也带两份过去。\n\n切记，简历一定要打印出来，电子版更多的时候只能作为线上传递使用，线下面试带上自己打印好的简历，是很重要的。\n\n\n# 4. 名片+简历配合使用\n\n名片是比硬简历更好的自我介绍，名片上有你目前的工作职位和企业标识，有你的名字、地址、邮箱、传真，甚至你的微信、QQ和二维码，虽然小，但名片是浓缩的简历，也方面面试官和HR收藏、携带。因此，在拿出简历的同时，你最好也递上自己的名片。\n\n面试时，对方接过去了你的名片，出于礼貌，你也能得到对方的名片，这样，你就有了面试官的联系方式，而不需要此后再千方百计通过猎头、HR去辗转询问面试结果了。有了手机号码，你懂的，基本都已经绑定了对方的微信、QQ以及微博，你就可以进入对方的“朋友圈”了，时不时点赞，则面试成功在望。\n\n有些面试官比较“狡猾”，说“呀！我忘了带名片。”没关系，你拿出事先准备好的纸和笔，让他、她写下手机号，座机也行，要么扫个二维码？\n\n给了名片，同时也是在告诉对方，你仍然在职，基本就已经刷掉了其他处于待业、失业、跨地区求职的竞争者，如果你发挥正常，HR和用人部门主管，自然会倾向于你。\n\n\n# 5. 简历的对象是谁？\n\n你求职，就是来出售自己五天八小时的工作时间，第一步是得能够卖得出去，其次则是卖个好价钱！这个“买卖”的过程中，谁最重要？你的简历所面对的人是谁？对了，一是HR，也就是挑选简历的那位人事专员；二用人部门主管。\n\n即使到了部门主管面试你的阶段，面试官也不会特意在约好的时间，让你现场读你的简历，他甚至不大会低头看你的简历，而是让你口述，并且以你俩的语言和表情交流为主，绝不是核对简历上你写的内容。\n\n所以，你要知道，简历在求职中的第一目的，就是给HR看。如果将整个求职过程（包括从投简历开始，到面试结束后谈工资、背景调查、发Offer、新单位报到的全过程）当做一场战斗的话，你的对手主要就是对方的人事部门。\n\n因此，明白了简历最重要的两个对象之后，你就要研究你的对手。HR是我们的主要对手，我们应该在整个求职过程中去分析HR的流程、方式和心理，研究他们的弱点，各个击破。而不是听对手（HR）告诉你应该怎么做。因此，做简历，可以适当参考HR的建议和意见，却不能全听HR的。简历就是用来投其所好的，却不一定要去问对方“你喜欢什么？”\n\n\n# 6. 简历的哪一部分最重要？\n\n我们从简历粗选开始。你想想看，你网上投递简历，手指轻轻一点，这成本才多少？一分钱吧！在目前经济下行压力下，又是竞争激烈的大环境中，发布任何一个职位后，人事小姑娘都会收到成百上千份简历。她这几天假使只负责5个职位的招聘，那么，接近5000份简历，你说该如何去挑选？\n\n每份简历平均4张纸，这就是2万张纸。正常200张纸的书压平，是1.5公分厚，2万张则是100本书折合1米5的厚度，HR一份一份简历去看？显然不是，根本来不及。\n\n于是，HR专员先要从投递这个职位的1000份简历中，粗选出50份，这就是粗选的过程。人事专员的目光放在你身上的时间，能有半小时不？当然没那么长，一分钟也不到，实际平均也就在5-10秒之间。如此短的时间她能看到什么呢？或者说她如何去甄别你是否合适呢？答案很直接也很简单：看简历上的基本信息。\n\n所以，对于我们求职者来说，最基本的“个人信息”是最重要的，这决定了你能否进入下一轮需要精选的那50人清单。其他啥你的爱好、特长、奖项、工作内容、业绩、参加的培训，等等，她在这一步一律不看，因为来不及看。\n\n如上，是智联招聘上某一简历的查看量，查看率刚过1/3，这是比较好的情况，用其他职位和其他人才网站的数据来总平均，1/5是正常的概率，也就是你投出去的简历，80%的可能性别人看都没看。\n\n\n# 7. 基本信息的核心是啥？\n\n那么，你觉得在这几秒钟内，HR最关注你个人信息中的哪几条呢？\n\n这几个要素有一个写得含糊或者对方难以理解，那么对不起，你被刷掉了。个人信息部分，每一点都要慎重。有的简历做得花俏，基本信息不但不全，还到处分布，以为很“美观”，结果这么“好看”的简历投出去上百份，没一点回音，犹如石沉大海。我们挨个来看。\n\n性别：\n\n一定要写，男就男，你别写个“帅哥”。“美女”也一样，这种措辞不可取。\n\n出生日期：\n\n注意，你得将这一项改成“出生年份”，不用写具体出生的日期，月份都不要写，企业只要知道你的年龄即可。记住：年轻的人事专员相信星座的可能性高达99%，你透露了自己的星座，有可能被“误杀”。这一点有人不认同，但我跟很多HR专员交流过，他们会看，而且无论概率多大，我们得在第一步中万无一失，这叫百密无一疏。\n\n学历：\n\n要写你的最高学历。如果你学历不高比如是大专，则你可以写个“本科在读”；较资深的职场老鸟，如果面试机会确实不多，你可以写个“硕士在读”；都做了主管了，你可以写个“MBA在读”。所谓“在读”，如果真能在这入职，那就去报考在职学位，跟简历保持一致。学历是敲门砖，在这里，有悟性的人尤其你这在职跳槽的大神，更容易秒懂。\n\n学校：\n\n不用写，除非你是清华北大等中国十大名校，或者国际知名学府。学校在基本信息中暂时不用写，因为后面的具体“教育、培训和资质”中，会详细写，以免重复。每个职位的硬性要求中都有学历要求，却没有学校要求，某些职位要求所谓“名牌大学”，这也是HR放到第二轮简历精选中去考察，这里先不用写，一节约篇幅，二多写多错。\n\n户籍：\n\n以在上海求职为例，如果你本地户籍，则写“上海”；如果你非本地户籍，则将“户籍”改成“所在城市”。\n\n目前职位：\n\n你目前的职位，很重要，一定要写，这是那几秒钟最需要捕捉的信息，你连这个都没写，还能找到好工作？HR直接就不看你了。\n\n目前薪资：\n\n写你过去12个月包括各种奖金在内的月均税前工资。这点很重要，新岗位的工资都是基于你的目前工资给一个增幅。\n\n期望职位：\n\n最好跟你之前的职位之一有延续性，采购员希望做采购主管，质量经理期望职位是质量总监，这就在正常认知范围之内。你如果想跨行，目标职位写成财务经理，咱先不用去担心是否能转行成功，光脚趾头动一下你就会知道，在第一步简历挑选部分你就已经被刷掉了。\n\n有人会说“我想转行”，那你另做一份简历，改下期望职位，并适当增加履历中该职位相关的内容描述，两份简历同时投递，只不过针对不同职位而已。人才网站上投递简历时，也会冒出来选项，让你选择“简历1”“简历2”。\n\n期望薪水：\n\n这最重要，期望薪资不能过高，也不可过低，更不能不写，你是个在职人士，目前薪资你完全了解，岂能期望薪资没有要求？你自作聪明，写个“面议”，实际上就已经错失了大多数面试的机会了。人事专员会看你的数字，是否落在她的预算区间。为了避免误判，你的期望薪资最好也写一个区间。\n\n比如你目前月薪10K，则期望薪水可以写成11-15K。看似才4千的薪水区间，实际上算上税前税后的区别，这是接近上下万元的月薪谈判余地。如果你这次面试感觉不错，且对方急着要你来上班，则你可以说15K是税后目标；相反，你面试发挥失常，这家知名公司的这个岗位，你自感不能完全胜任但又很想得到，则在谈薪水的时候就说，这里的下线11K是税前月薪要求；等等，还有各种情况，你届时临场发挥。\n\n1000份简历挑选出50份，也就是从这份简历投递的成功率来看，个人信息部分的重要性达到了95%，等你能进入那不到5%的精选清单后，简历剩余部分才会有被看到的机会。\n\n既然跳槽，当然是加薪、晋级、换行中至少有一个能实现，或者进入行业内的大公司。所以，这里我们默认对方就是顶级公司，最好就是世界五百强或者国内大公司，不考虑内资小企业。小企业招人难，一个职位不会有那么多投递量，招聘专员都没有，人事部就一个人，做全部人事和行政工作。他、她也许有时间，一封一封简历看，但这不在我们在职跳槽的雇主对象之内。\n\n\n# 8. 简历中的“个人综述”怎么写？\n\n这就到了HR筛选简历的第二步，50份简历挑出10份更好的。她会看你“长篇累牍”的工作内容描述，还是更短的个人综述？当然是后者。\n\n所以，“个人综述”部分，要放到“个人信息”之后“工作经验”之前。这部分不用多写，切忌长篇大论、写散文、讲故事，很多人维持学生的思维，在这里喜欢讲故事，还会写上自己爱好、特长以及未来的梦想，甚至啥座右铭......你还爱好周游世界呢，这跟工作有啥关系？我们不是学生，而是职场资深求职者，得有资深的样子。\n\n个人综述部分，4-5条即可，最重要的是某一个行业中某个专业领域的工作年数，其次，你有而他人没有的资历、证书、技能、品质等，比如本例中的10年财务工作经验和注册会计师资格。\n\n实在没得写，你最后可以凑一句“能在强大压力下工作，可适应出差。”这就是人无我有。\n\n\n# 9. 工作经验如何写？\n\n通过个人综述的识别之后，人事专员大多会将50份简历精简到10份，此后才会进入跟该岗位的描述（JD）进行一一比对的环节。这时候，你的工作经验才真正出场了。\n\n大多数人都误解，以为这是整个简历最重要的部分，想当然地以为对方第一眼是看“工作经验”部分。明白了以上的实际合理经过后，你才会知道，到达这一步（1000份简历挑出10份），得经过粗选和精选两个过程，你的工作经验部分才能被看到，这么看来其展示率只有1%的概率。\n\n本文以上干货，以及接下来的内容，虽然跟你平常的想象有点出入，甚至刷新了你的潜意识，但确是大量总结，并跟HR和猎头们讨论、整理出来的真知灼见。\n\n当然，战略上藐视它战术上重视它，无论如何，我们既然做简历，自然每一部分都要认真对待。HR当然也会去看你的工作经验描述，但她主要看你最近这份工作，而且她不会逐条去看，能不能看得懂是一方面，有没有时间去看，则是最大的问题。\n\n除了最近的这份工作，其他工作经历HR就基本不会再细致去看了，快速扫一下公司名即可。如果你之前在知名公司，比如说“华为”“苹果”“BAT”包括富士康待过，她会捕捉到这个信息，其他工作内容基本就不看了。\n\n我们也不要气愤，自己精心写就的工作执掌，HR居然不认真看，实际上HR只要掌握几个关键词即可，她为何要认真看呢？再说，那么多简历，你真当人是机器啊！况且，你不用担心，部门主管会认真看你的履历的。还有一个更大的原因，企业招人，更主要是看此人作为合格候选者的职场综合素质，却不是简历中具体某一条你的工作内容描述。\n\n前文也说了，对于工作经验这部分，面试你的部门主管是主要对象，但你俩也会以面对面看着对方眼睛去口头交流为主，而不是一起读你写的工作经验。\n\n最要认真写的工作经验，就是你目前在做的这一份工。所以，最近的这份工作经历，要多写一点工作内容，比方说8-10条；上家以及上上家甚至上上上家，简写即可，3-6条简述为宜。\n\n总体而言，工作经验按照时间的倒序来列出来，每家的工作经历都最好加上序列号列成条数，不要当做一篇不分行的文章，没人愿意看你的作文。\n\n如果你有突出的“工作成就和业绩”，可以在“工作经验”后面增加上去，一两个重点项目一句话描述即可，不能长篇大论，也要视篇幅情况而定。\n\n\n# 10. 其余信息最好整合在一起\n\n简历的最后部分，将毕业院校、专业以及各种培训、资质、证书以及奖励，都写到最后一部分“教育、培训和资质”中去。\n\n你拥有的特长，已经和将要取得的证书，包括那个“在读”的本科、硕士、博士，在这里也可以写一下，能为接下来的工作服务即可，不用累赘，逐个列明。\n\n外语、计算机以及各类等级证书，也在这里写。\n\n\n# 11. 你的简历得多方出击\n\n以上，根据求职的重要性，我们将跳槽简历的写法，详细介绍清楚了，捋了一遍。这么好的简历，你这样一位人才，你别光上“前程无忧”“智联招聘”，也需要试试其他招聘网站。“领英”“猎聘”“大街”“拉勾”“BOSS直聘”等等已经分流了很多招聘职位。\n\n你得网络海投，今天投出这份简历，真的以后能去报到上班的概率，可能只有千分之一。在经济增长率不断下行的今天，我们不能只通过网络招聘来找工作，成功率太低了。不信你试试看，你投100份简历出去，看看能有多少回音。有一个面试电话，叫做幸运；有两次，则叫做中彩。\n\n所以，简历投递的渠道挑选，也是一门技术，跳槽得多方出击。某一行工作经验丰富的专家，突然失业了，你让他去找工作试试，在找工作的技能方面，他成了白痴。在社会加速变迁的当下，每一个行业都在不断淘汰和更新，某一个具体的职务可能过几年就消失了。所以，这句话“在某一个行业内做专你就会成功”，已经有待商榷了。谁也不能保证一辈子不失业，跳槽技能必不可少。\n\n回到简历渠道上来，对人才免费的猎头、收费的人才中介、亲友内部推荐等等猎聘渠道，当然也要提上投简历找工作的日程，这类渠道的求职成功率大致为10%-20%的水平。\n\n经过统计数据分析，可得出规律：宅男宅女和所谓的“屌丝”以及某一方面的“专家”，更喜欢网络海投简历，以为“靠技术吃饭”，他/她自己都不知道投简历也需要技术，号称靠技术吃饭的人反而在技术上栽了跟头；职位较高的金领和海归人士，更喜欢猎聘渠道，好像他们不屑于海投简历一样，也是“一根筋”，这里他们也忽略了其他渠道，所以这部分人跳槽更困难，没掌握投递简历的技巧。\n\n最重要的渠道来了，在中国找工作，最重要的是关系介绍，虽然“说你行你就行不行也行”有点夸张，但中国整体的就业市场，尽管在走向市场化公开化，但你问下身边人，你可以随意调查100个人，最终会发现一半以上的人，其当下的工作是关系介绍而达成的。\n\n所以，当你准备找工作的时候，首先想到的应该是去挖掘你的关系，更重要的则是你没准备跳槽的时候就大量培养自己的社会关系。靠关系能找到工作的成功率，超过50%，这是不争的事实。别说你没关系，你用心去找找看。你可以挑选身边除同事之外的10位好友，告诉他她“我本科毕业做了3年行政工作，目前想换工作。”接下来三个月内你就等着好消息吧，有心的人自然会帮你去留意。\n\n想跳槽，海投简历、猎聘渠道、亲友推荐等等，我们的简历得多方出击。\n\n\n# 12. 跳槽简历的时间技巧\n\n简历投递需要掌握时间，多了是重复投递，少了面试机会不够。\n\n从投递第一份简历出去，到真的入职上班，以往年份一般是3个月时间；2015年增加到接近4个月；2016-2017的数据增加到接近5个月，这是统计规律；展望下2018年，事实证明，跳槽是个历时半年的过程。当你找工作，不要期望今天投简历，明后天就能去上班，这是一个持久战，此间你有的是事情去做，去完善这次跳槽，而不是就一个字“等”。\n\n有了意向之后，对方跟你商量报到日期时，尽量往后拖，因为此间可能还会有更好的Offer过来，可能晚了几天而已。注意，是尽量拖，实在拖不了，则也得在上家离职后才能去报到。这里注意的就是领导故意不放你走，说来奇怪，很多人会为难下属辞职，通过交接工作和完成项目等众多手法，让你不能按时离职。防人之心不可无，这里你得在提出辞职后，加快工作交接。\n\n在收到第一份Offer之后，不要急着提出辞职，而是将简历上的期望薪水调整下，在目前这个Offer的基础上，再增加30%继续投递简历，争取更好的面试机会。提出离职后，还有一个月的时间交接，正是大好的投递简历和面试的好时机。\n\n报到之后，处于试用期的你，如果有更好的面试机会，不要错过，试用期也要尽量面试，否则容易错过更好的工作，此间的请假也是一门技巧。\n\n有人问“试用期的工作经验要不要写在简历上？”这得根据时间来判断，如果你才入职一个月不到，则当然不用写。如果你已经来此工作5个月，下月转正，则这份最近的工作经历，也得放入简历之中。不用怕，这不是显示你不稳定一直想跳槽，而是突出你对工作、对企业、对职业生涯、对这次跳槽的慎重，因为感觉到你们更合适我这才来面试。\n\n新工作转正之前，不要掉以轻心，工作要上进，加加班牺牲点私人时间，也是有必要的，否则不能转正，就失业了。失业了，更不好找工作，远比在职跳槽难多了。\n\n以上，是跳槽简历秘笈，很多细节技巧，职场老司机也大多不懂，你好好利用。我们下次再讲“失业人员的简历”、“应届生简历秘笈”，您可以如下二维码赞赏下，你的鼓励是尽快出品的动力。",normalizedContent:"# 前言\n\n在职求职跳槽和应届生求职区别很大。刚毕业的时候，根据对应学历找工作，就是从零开始，各大资本方对于这类人群，工资都是预设好的，没有浮动空间的。但随着工作年限的增加，工作经验的增加，劳动者在劳动力市场的价值其实已经获得了无形的增长。一个明显的变化就是，应届生刚参加工作，人们的宽容性通常会很高，工作内容更多的是打杂，但随着工作年限增加，开始接触核心工作内容，资本的要求也会变严格，工作后的履历过往，配合学历，成为资本选择的一大要素。\n\n这个时候，跳槽简历就是这些重要信息的承载体，是劳动者在资本眼中的第一印象。我们要认识到找工作的本质是与资本的博弈，是残酷的，容不得一丝幻想的，而简历是当前社会形势下最基本的，要是简历都没做好，岂不是吃饭不带碗。\n\n提示\n\n劳动者在这个过程中逐渐融入资本的发展环境之中，通过付出自身的劳动力与资本达成协议，换取收入。这里再往下深入就是资本论的原理内容了，挖个跳转链接的(坑)，说不定哪天就会更新了。\n\n\n总之，一定要记住的是，除非自己是公司所有者，掌握着生产资料，雇佣方(即资本)和劳动者之间，是存在根本的矛盾冲突的，且是不可完全调和的，原因简单来讲就是利益，资本家和无产者的利益导向不同，驱使着一切。资本家想要的是资本的无限增殖，是剥削更多的剩余价值(给最低的工资，干最累的活)；无产者想要的则是更高的收入，获得维持日常生活所必须的生活资料，并寻求提高生活质量。\n\n\n以上所说的并不是危言耸听，利益的根本不同会最终导致资本家与无产者之间存在无法调和的根本矛盾，这是不以人的意志为转移的客观规律。\n\n本篇就是跳槽简历的要点，大纲如下：\n\n

1. 简历的种类\n\n求职的人，分三种：应届毕业生，失业后求职的人，在职跳槽的人。\n\n应届生，自然就是即将进入社会的人，他们需要先找份工作，这才能正式进入社会。看下历年的应届生毕业人数，2021年有909万进入社会，2022年数据刚出来是1076万。这是巨大的就业压力，还不包括大学以下学历的毕业生、未就业的往届生、海龟生、考研考公那种“二战”失败的人。总的来说，应届生每年有大致1200万进入职场来求职。\n\n\n\n每年市场均需消化如此巨大的劳动力，如果任由自由经济市场主导，其无序性、自发性、盲动性乃至投机性可能会酿成重大的社会危机，在残酷的竞争下数以百万计的高校毕业生无法找到合适的工作，成为社会上的闲散人员，将有可能导致很大的社会问题。因此应届生就业是会带有国家政策导向的，而后随着应届生投入工作，开始成为劳动人民的一员后，从大数定律上来说，失业也开始了。导致失业的原因有很多，这里不做具体分析，但失业后的人，大多在会再找工作，这些人在哪？看下你身边不上班的人，除了少数已经实现所谓财务自由，大多数人还是要找工作的，也正在找工作中，他们时非在职状态的求职者。这个群体包括冒然裸辞的人、短期失业的人、单位转产破产失去工作的人、被裁员工、创业失败重找工作的人、全职太太重返职场，等等。\n\n保守估算下，总人口14亿中适龄劳动力人口有一半，这7亿按照官方经常公布的“失业率3-5%”的最低比例来计，7亿的3%，失业后的求职者大概2千万人。\n\n将应届生与这类失业人群加起来，保守估计3000万，虽然没有在职的人多，但因为他们时刻在投简历求职，所以，在求职者中占比还是很高的。这里就可以理解，为何你的简历投出去杳无音信，为何一个职位有成百上千个人投递了。\n\n综上，简历当然是按照人来分的：应届生的简历，失业人员的简历，跳槽人士的简历。三者自然各有侧重，也各有特点，我们今天要讲的就是，跳槽人士的简历如何制作。当然，如果你不是在职跳槽，也可以继续往下看，毕竟理念和方法都有想通的地方，另外，你也可以等我后续的“应届生简历如何制作？”“失业人员简历如何写？”比较下，才加强印象，这是最高效的学习。\n\n\n# 2. 简历的形式\n\n简历就是一个形式，能代表你这个劳动力即可，它需要根据具体情况用恰当的方式来体现，实际上并不拘泥于某一固定的形式，简历也并不仅仅是那几张纸。\n\n你目前还年轻，你不知道未来还有很多地方要你做简历：你表现好单位要提升你做主管时，要你做一份简历给人事部门；你报考在职硕士、博士等更高学位，学校会让你提供一份简历；你做生意，加盟还是合伙，总部和合伙人都要你提供简历；你的孩子读小学、初中、高中等等，你都要给孩子做简历，还要附上孩子父母也就是你们夫妻俩的简历......\n\n最简单的简历，就是一次闲聊，一场亲友聚会中你的表现。那边正好有个岗位空缺，熟人或者熟人的熟人觉得你比较合适，直接就可以上岗了，你的言谈举止，就是一份简历。这不但是最简单的简历，也是最牛掰的简历。大家不要过分拘泥于简历的形式，我们常说的“我要感谢自己职场上的贵人”，这个“贵人”识人时，大多不看简历，而是看言行举止，通过聊天去面试人。\n\n诸葛亮“隆中对”时秀给刘皇叔的三分天下之霸业理论，就是在秀自己的才华和谋略，还有口才，这就是最恰到好处的简历。引申到现在，行业口碑、业内名号、成就业绩等等，包括你的言谈举止和平时的为人作风，都是你的简历。时至今日，大老板们也更喜欢平时通过这种方式，去猎得自己需要的资深职员、主管、经理、总监、副总等人才。\n\n当然，我们更多的人，则是通过陌生面试来取得新工作。这里，在职人士的优势就来了，相比较于另两类求职者（应届生、待业失业人员）而言，我们在职，我们有名片。纸质名片、电子名片，都是名片，这就是最好的简历。如果你通过名片找到了好工作，这就是你牛逼的地方。\n\n圈内好友聚会，同学聚餐，行业交流会，群友聚会，等等，是我们分发名片的好时机，别小看了它们，好的工作机会就潜伏于好友朋友圈的聚会之时。大道至简，极简模式的简历，就是一张名片，彼此都很放松并信任的时候，名片就是最好的简历。\n\n有人说“我毫无职场关系”，那就只能通过猎头介绍、同学内推、网络投递等等方式去求职了。用这种陌生面试的方法去找工作时，传统意义上的那几张纸的简历，才发挥了作用。\n\n可以说，排除了职场关系后的求职，那几页a4纸打印的简历，就是当下最实用的简历。\n\n除此之外，你还可以制作ppt简历，来一段视频简介，甚至通过自己的网站等等来展示自己，这些都是硬简历的附属简历形式，可以根据具体情况来“出牌”。\n\n什么山上唱什么歌，比如我，参加年轻人的聚会，我可以送他她们几本自己签名的书；跟作家和文化圈子的人聚会，我秀下自媒体的文章和公众号头条号知乎号；跟老外相处我带他体会下中国文化，讲下中国历史；我去面试，这些就都不能讲了，也派不上用场，容易适得其反，我得秀我的职业履历......\n\n有如此多的简历形式，总体来看，“名片+a4简历”的形式，是最适合我们在职跳槽人士的。\n\n\n# 3. 如何选一个好的简历模板？\n\n简历就是你自己，尤其是针对经验丰富的职场人士。当我们去某宝或者微店搜索，能看到很多“简历制作”“简历修改”“简历优化”服务，单价从1块到3000元不等。但他们只能帮你美化简历上的字体、图片、布局，却不能帮你修改简历上的内容，连你原来简历中的错别字，也不敢修改。你别被“优化”“修改”字眼欺骗了，所以，简历必须得自己做。\n\n我今天就是来教你，如何对自己的简历来做大刀阔虎的改变，来一次简历大整容，而不仅仅是美容。\n\n大家注意下，网络投递简历时，每家人才招聘网站，都有自己的简历模板，往里面填写即可。但在猎头、亲友、熟人内推问我们要简历时，在我们去参加现场面试之时，是要带着一份打印好的简历过去的，这就是我们今天要讲的真正的简历。\n\n大家可以通过各种渠道搜寻简历模板，挑选2份自己最喜欢的简历模板。都是职场人士，都准备跳槽了，常联系的猎头总有几个吧？问他们各要几个简历模板，比方说有5份你喜欢。\n\n接着，你喜欢的，不一定是最好的，群众的眼睛才是雪亮的。所以，这5份简历，你分别展示给自己的好友看看，请他们打分。最终得票最高的那份，才是相对来说最好的简历模板。整理一下，将自己的信息录入，打印下来，放一份在身上，平时看看，有面试电话过来时，更可以拿出来跟对方交流，以免突然卡壳。每次面试时，也带两份过去。\n\n切记，简历一定要打印出来，电子版更多的时候只能作为线上传递使用，线下面试带上自己打印好的简历，是很重要的。\n\n\n# 4. 名片+简历配合使用\n\n名片是比硬简历更好的自我介绍，名片上有你目前的工作职位和企业标识，有你的名字、地址、邮箱、传真，甚至你的微信、qq和二维码，虽然小，但名片是浓缩的简历，也方面面试官和hr收藏、携带。因此，在拿出简历的同时，你最好也递上自己的名片。\n\n面试时，对方接过去了你的名片，出于礼貌，你也能得到对方的名片，这样，你就有了面试官的联系方式，而不需要此后再千方百计通过猎头、hr去辗转询问面试结果了。有了手机号码，你懂的，基本都已经绑定了对方的微信、qq以及微博，你就可以进入对方的“朋友圈”了，时不时点赞，则面试成功在望。\n\n有些面试官比较“狡猾”，说“呀！我忘了带名片。”没关系，你拿出事先准备好的纸和笔，让他、她写下手机号，座机也行，要么扫个二维码？\n\n给了名片，同时也是在告诉对方，你仍然在职，基本就已经刷掉了其他处于待业、失业、跨地区求职的竞争者，如果你发挥正常，hr和用人部门主管，自然会倾向于你。\n\n\n# 5. 简历的对象是谁？\n\n你求职，就是来出售自己五天八小时的工作时间，第一步是得能够卖得出去，其次则是卖个好价钱！这个“买卖”的过程中，谁最重要？你的简历所面对的人是谁？对了，一是hr，也就是挑选简历的那位人事专员；二用人部门主管。\n\n即使到了部门主管面试你的阶段，面试官也不会特意在约好的时间，让你现场读你的简历，他甚至不大会低头看你的简历，而是让你口述，并且以你俩的语言和表情交流为主，绝不是核对简历上你写的内容。\n\n所以，你要知道，简历在求职中的第一目的，就是给hr看。如果将整个求职过程（包括从投简历开始，到面试结束后谈工资、背景调查、发offer、新单位报到的全过程）当做一场战斗的话，你的对手主要就是对方的人事部门。\n\n因此，明白了简历最重要的两个对象之后，你就要研究你的对手。hr是我们的主要对手，我们应该在整个求职过程中去分析hr的流程、方式和心理，研究他们的弱点，各个击破。而不是听对手（hr）告诉你应该怎么做。因此，做简历，可以适当参考hr的建议和意见，却不能全听hr的。简历就是用来投其所好的，却不一定要去问对方“你喜欢什么？”\n\n\n# 6. 简历的哪一部分最重要？\n\n我们从简历粗选开始。你想想看，你网上投递简历，手指轻轻一点，这成本才多少？一分钱吧！在目前经济下行压力下，又是竞争激烈的大环境中，发布任何一个职位后，人事小姑娘都会收到成百上千份简历。她这几天假使只负责5个职位的招聘，那么，接近5000份简历，你说该如何去挑选？\n\n每份简历平均4张纸，这就是2万张纸。正常200张纸的书压平，是1.5公分厚，2万张则是100本书折合1米5的厚度，hr一份一份简历去看？显然不是，根本来不及。\n\n于是，hr专员先要从投递这个职位的1000份简历中，粗选出50份，这就是粗选的过程。人事专员的目光放在你身上的时间，能有半小时不？当然没那么长，一分钟也不到，实际平均也就在5-10秒之间。如此短的时间她能看到什么呢？或者说她如何去甄别你是否合适呢？答案很直接也很简单：看简历上的基本信息。\n\n所以，对于我们求职者来说，最基本的“个人信息”是最重要的，这决定了你能否进入下一轮需要精选的那50人清单。其他啥你的爱好、特长、奖项、工作内容、业绩、参加的培训，等等，她在这一步一律不看，因为来不及看。\n\n如上，是智联招聘上某一简历的查看量，查看率刚过1/3，这是比较好的情况，用其他职位和其他人才网站的数据来总平均，1/5是正常的概率，也就是你投出去的简历，80%的可能性别人看都没看。\n\n\n#

基本信息的核心是啥？\n\n那么，你觉得在这几秒钟内，hr最关注你个人信息中的哪几条呢？\n\n这几个要素有一个写得含糊或者对方难以理解，那么对不起，你被刷掉了。个人信息部分，每一点都要慎重。有的简历做得花俏，基本信息不但不全，还到处分布，以为很“美观”，结果这么“好看”的简历投出去上百份，没一点回音，犹如石沉大海。我们挨个来看。\n\n性别：\n\n一定要写，男就男，你别写个“帅哥”。“美女”也一样，这种措辞不可取。\n\n出生日期：\n\n注意，你得将这一项改成“出生年份”，不用写具体出生的日期，月份都不要写，企业只要知道你的年龄即可。记住：年轻的人事专员相信星座的可能性高达99%，你透露了自己的星座，有可能被“误杀”。这一点有人不认同，但我跟很多hr专员交流过，他们会看，而且无论概率多大，我们得在第一步中万无一失，这叫百密无一疏。\n\n学历：\n\n要写你的最高学历。如果你学历不高比如是大专，则你可以写个“本科在读”；较资深的职场老鸟，如果面试机会确实不多，你可以写个“硕士在读”；都做了主管了，你可以写个“mba在读”。所谓“在读”，如果真能在这入职，那就去报考在职学位，跟简历保持一致。学历是敲门砖，在这里，有悟性的人尤其你这在职跳槽的大神，更容易秒懂。\n\n学校：\n\n不用写，除非你是清华北大等中国十大名校，或者国际知名学府。学校在基本信息中暂时不用写，因为后面的具体“教育、培训和资质”中，会详细写，以免重复。每个职位的硬性要求中都有学历要求，却没有学校要求，某些职位要求所谓“名牌大学”，这也是hr放到第二轮简历精选中去考察，这里先不用写，一节约篇幅，二多写多错。\n\n户籍：\n\n以在上海求职为例，如果你本地户籍，则写“上海”；如果你非本地户籍，则将“户籍”改成“所在城市”。\n\n目前职位：\n\n你目前的职位，很重要，一定要写，这是那几秒钟最需要捕捉的信息，你连这个都没写，还能找到好工作？hr直接就不看你了。\n\n目前薪资：\n\n写你过去12个月包括各种奖金在内的月均税前工资。这点很重要，新岗位的工资都是基于你的目前工资给一个增幅。\n\n期望职位：\n\n最好跟你之前的职位之一有延续性，采购员希望做采购主管，质量经理期望职位是质量总监，这就在正常认知范围之内。你如果想跨行，目标职位写成财务经理，咱先不用去担心是否能转行成功，光脚趾头动一下你就会知道，在第一步简历挑选部分你就已经被刷掉了。\n\n有人会说“我想转行”，那你另做一份简历，改下期望职位，并适当增加履历中该职位相关的内容描述，两份简历同时投递，只不过针对不同职位而已。人才网站上投递简历时，也会冒出来选项，让你选择“简历1”“简历2”。\n\n期望薪水：\n\n这最重要，期望薪资不能过高，也不可过低，更不能不写，你是个在职人士，目前薪资你完全了解，岂能期望薪资没有要求？你自作聪明，写个“面议”，实际上就已经错失了大多数面试的机会了。人事专员会看你的数字，是否落在她的预算区间。为了避免误判，你的期望薪资最好也写一个区间。\n\n比如你目前月薪10k，则期望薪水可以写成11-15k。看似才4千的薪水区间，实际上算上税前税后的区别，这是接近上下万元的月薪谈判余地。如果你这次面试感觉不错，且对方急着要你来上班，则你可以说15k是税后目标；相反，你面试发挥失常，这家知名公司的这个岗位，你自感不能完全胜任但又很想得到，则在谈薪水的时候就说，这里的下线11k是税前月薪要求；等等，还有各种情况，你届时临场发挥。\n\n1000份简历挑选出50份，也就是从这份简历投递的成功率来看，个人信息部分的重要性达到了95%，等你能进入那不到5%的精选清单后，简历剩余部分才会有被看到的机会。\n\n既然跳槽，当然是加薪、晋级、换行中至少有一个能实现，或者进入行业内的大公司。所以，这里我们默认对方就是顶级公司，最好就是世界五百强或者国内大公司，不考虑内资小企业。小企业招人难，一个职位不会有那么多投递量，招聘专员都没有，人事部就一个人，做全部人事和行政工作。他、她也许有时间，一封一封简历看，但这不在我们在职跳槽的雇主对象之内。\n\n\n# 8. 简历中的“个人综述”怎么写？\n\n这就到了hr筛选简历的第二步，50份简历挑出10份更好的。她会看你“长篇累牍”的工作内容描述，还是更短的个人综述？当然是后者。\n\n所以，“个人综述”部分，要放到“个人信息”之后“工作经验”之前。这部分不用多写，切忌长篇大论、写散文、讲故事，很多人维持学生的思维，在这里喜欢讲故事，还会写上自己爱好、特长以及未来的梦想，甚至啥座右铭......你还爱好周游世界呢，这跟工作有啥关系？我们不是学生，而是职场资深求职者，得有资深的样子。\n\n个人综述部分，4-5条即可，最重要的是某一个行业中某个专业领域的工作年数，其次，你有而他人没有的资历、证书、技能、品质等，比如本例中的10年财务工作经验和注册会计师资格。\n\n实在没得写，你最后可以凑一句“能在强大压力下工作，可适应出差。”这就是人无我有。\n\n\n# 9. 工作经验如何写？\n\n通过个人综述的识别之后，人事专员大多会将50份简历精简到10份，此后才会进入跟该岗位的描述（jd）进行一一比对的环节。这时候，你的工作经验才真正出场了。\n\n大多数人都误解，以为这是整个简历最重要的部分，想当然地以为对方第一眼是看“工作经验”部分。明白了以上的实际合理经过后，你才会知道，到达这一步（1000份简历挑出10份），得经过粗选和精选两个过程，你的工作经验部分才能被看到，这么看来其展示率只有1%的概率。\n\n本文以上干货，以及接下来的内容，虽然跟你平常的想象有点出入，甚至刷新了你的潜意识，但确是大量总结，并跟hr和猎头们讨论、整理出来的真知灼见。\n\n当然，战略上藐视它战术上重视它，无论如何，我们既然做简历，自然每一部分都要认真对待。hr当然也会去看你的工作经验描述，但她主要看你最近这份工作，而且她不会逐条去看，能不能看得懂是一方面，有没有时间去看，则是最大的问题。\n\n除了最近的这份工作，其他工作经历hr就基本不会再细致去看了，快速扫一下公司名即可。如果你之前在知名公司，比如说“华为”“苹果”“bat”包括富士康待过，她会捕捉到这个信息，其他工作内容基本就不看了。\n\n我们也不要气愤，自己精心写就的工作执掌，hr居然不认真看，实际上hr只要掌握几个关键词即可，她为何要认真看呢？再说，那么多简历，你真当人是机器啊！况且，你不用担心，部门主管会认真看你的履历的。还有一个更大的原因，企业招人，更主要是看此人作为合格候选者的职场综合素质，却不是简历中具体某一条你的工作内容描述。\n\n前文也说了，对于工作经验这部分，面试你的部门主管是主要对象，但你俩也会以面对面看着对方眼睛去口头交流为主，而不是一起读你写的工作经验。\n\n最要认真写的工作经验，就是你目前在做的这一份工。所以，最近的这份工作经历，要多写一点工作内容，比方说8-10条；上家以及上上家甚至上上上家，简写即可，3-6条简述为宜。\n\n总体而言，工作经验按照时间的倒序来列出来，每家的工作经历都最好加上序列号列成条数，不要当做一篇不分行的文章，没人愿意看你的作文。\n\n如果你有突出的“工作成就和业绩”，可以在“工作经验”后面增加上去，一两个重点项目一句话描述即可，不能长篇大论，也要视篇幅情况而定。\n\n\n# 10. 其余信息最好整合在一起\n\n简历的最后部分，将毕业院校、专业以及各种培训、资质、证书以及奖励，都写到最后一部分“教育、培训和资质”中去。\n\n你拥有的特长，已经和将要取得的证书，包括那个“在读”的本科、硕士、博士，在这里也可以写一下，能为接下来的工作服务即可，不用累赘，逐个列明。\n\n外语、计算机以及各类等级证书，也在这里写。\n\n\n# 11. 你的简历得多方出击\n\n以上，根据求职的重要性，我们将跳槽简历的写法，详细介绍清楚了，捋了一遍。这么好的简历，你这样一位人才，你别光上“前程无忧”“智联招聘”，也需要试试其他招聘网站。“领英”“猎聘”“大街”“拉勾”“boss直聘”等等已经分流了很多招聘职位。\n\n你得网络海投，今天投出这份简历，真的以后能去报到上班的概率，可能只有千分之一。在经济增长率不断下行的今天，我们不能只通过网络招聘来找工作，成功率太低了。不信你试试看，你投100份简历出去，看看能有多少回音。有一个面试电话，叫做幸运；有两次，则叫做中彩。\n\n所以，简历投递的渠道挑选，也是一门技术，跳槽得多方出击。某一行工作经验丰富的专家，突然失业了，你让他去找工作试试，在找工作的技能方面，他成了白痴。在社会加速变迁的当下，每一个行业都在不断淘汰和更新，某一个具体的职务可能过几年就消失了。所以，这句话“在某一个行业内做专你就会成功”，已经有待商榷了。谁也不能保证一辈子不失业，跳槽技能必不可少。\n\n回到简历渠道上来，对人才免费的猎头、收费的人才中介、亲友内部推荐等等猎聘渠道，当然也要提上投简历找工作的日程，这类渠道的求职成功率大致为10%-20%的水平。\n\n经过统计数据分析，可得出规律：宅男宅女和所谓的“屌丝”以及某一方面的“专家”，更喜欢网络海投简历，以为“靠技术吃饭”，他/她自己都不知道投简历也需要技术，号称靠技术吃饭的人反而在技术上栽了跟头；职位较高的金领和海归人士，更喜欢猎聘渠道，好像他们不屑于海投简历一样，也是“一根筋”，这里他们也忽略了其他渠道，所以这部分人跳槽更困难，没掌握投递简历的技巧。\n\n最重要的渠道来了，在中国找工作，最重要的是关系介绍，虽然“说你行你就行不行也行”有点夸张，但中国整体的就业市场，尽管在走向市场化公开化，但你问下身边人，你可以随意调查100个人，最终会发现一半以上的人，其当下的工作是关系介绍而达成的。\n\n所以，当你准备找工作的时候，首先想到的应该是去挖掘你的关系，更重要的则是你没准备跳槽的时候就大量培养自己的社会关系。靠关系能找到工作的成功率，超过50%，这是不争的事实。别说你没关系，你用心去找找看。你可以挑选身边除同事之外的10位好友，告诉他她“我本科毕业做了3年行政工作，目前想换工作。”接下来三个月内你就等着好消息吧，有心的人自然会帮你去留意。\n\n想跳槽，海投简历、猎聘渠道、亲友推荐等等，我们的简历得多方出击。\n\n\n# 12. 跳槽简历的时间技巧\n\n简历投递需要掌握时间，多了是重复投递，少了面试机会不够。\n\n从投递第一份简历出去，到真的入职上班，以往年份一般是3个月时间；2015年增加到接近4个月；2016-2017的数据增加到接近5个月，这是统计规律；展望下2018年，事实证明，跳槽是个历时半年的过程。当你找工作，不要期望今天投简历，明后天就能去上班，这是一个持久战，此间你有的是事情去做，去完善这次跳槽，而不是就一个字“等”。\n\n有了意向之后，对方跟你商量报到日期时，尽量往后拖，因为此间可能还会有更好的offer过来，可能晚了几天而已。注意，是尽量拖，实在拖不了，则也得在上家离职后才能去报到。这里注意的就是领导故意不放你走，说来奇怪，很多人会为难下属辞职，通过交接工作和完成项目等众多手法，让你不能按时离职。防人之心不可无，这里你得在提出辞职后，加快工作交接。\n\n在收到第一份offer之后，不要急着提出辞职，而是将简历上的期望薪水调整下，在目前这个offer的基础上，再增加30%继续投递简历，争取更好的面试机会。提出离职后，还有一个月的时间交接，正是大好的投递简历和面试的好时机。\n\n报到之后，处于试用期的你，如果有更好的面试机会，不要错过，试用期也要尽量面试，否则容易错过更好的工作，此间的请假也是一门技巧。\n\n有人问“试用期的工作经验要不要写在简历上？”这得根据时间来判断，如果你才入职一个月不到，则当然不用写。如果你已经来此工作5个月，下月转正，则这份最近的工作经历，也得放入简历之中。不用怕，这不是显示你不稳定一直想跳槽，而是突出你对工作、对企业、对职业生涯、对这次跳槽的慎重，因为感觉到你们更合适我这才来面试。\n\n新工作转正之前，不要掉以轻心，工作要上进，加加班牺牲点私人时间，也是有必要的，否则不能转正，就失业了。失业了，更不好找工作，远比在职跳槽难多了。\n\n以上，是跳槽简历秘笈，很多细节技巧，职场老司机也大多不懂，你好好利用。我们下次再讲“失业人员的简历”、“应届生简历秘笈”，您可以如下二维码赞赏下，你的鼓励是尽快出品的动力。",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/04/16

序言\n\n我们一直讲求职技巧、跳槽技艺，但是你别忘了，10亿成年人中有差不多2亿人做着稳定的工作，他们是不跳槽的。\n\n所以我们很多体制内群友看着这个跳槽、那个换工作的，感觉很憋屈，因为自己用不到这些知识。其实你是幸运的，你都不用担心被裁员，也不需要跳槽，何其幸哉！\n\n另外8亿人在体制外，但这些所谓工作不稳定的人，某一年换了工作的概率也不过1/10，也就是职场人不是一直在换工作，90%的人当年是不跳槽的，也算稳定。\n\n以上无论体制内外，当我们不换工作时，职场考察你的就是不在于求职技能，而是工作技能，工作技能的核心是你如何很好地待下去。\n\n按照书本知识和常理，“我好好待着，努力做好自己的事情，那么一切就没问题了”......这句话是错的，因为你工作就是与人相处，光埋头做你的事情这是不够的，事情是人做的，也是人让你去做的，你做好后也是交给人。你不去挑事，也会有人来找你的麻烦。\n\n今年我主业退休，赶在退休之年再做几个一对一指导。在春节以来新收的10来个职场徒弟中，也有3位是过去已经指导过的人，他们这是想再拜山门。其实我一般不大乐意接他们，因为指导年薪四五十万再跳七八十万，要比指导20万跳40万难多了。一般都是婉拒。 其实通往职业成功的道路上，无论体制内外，也无论谁，都会碰到不少关口，只是重大关口时，你无所适从，自己又摸不到头脑，确实也难过。就看体制外职业经理人道路，最重要的就是两个时间节点，第一次是从低薪跨越年薪30万。说起来容易做起来难。\n\n过往的职场徒弟来找我，主要就是为了突破这一步，可能他们觉得自己C男C女甚至D男D女，起点很低、现状糟糕，没人指导自己达不成，拿到了Offer也不敢入职、不够自信。这一步是坐实B男B女，别试用期被辞退，还多次被裁，仍然会滑下来，台阶无法建立。一般都需要待住12个月有了一年的工资流水，这步才算站稳了。\n\n在走向年薪百万职业经理人的道路上，更难的当然是下一步，此为第二个节点，即40万跳60-80万甚至百万，这是走进A男A女行列。在这一步骤中，我看我过去的职场徒弟，比如每100位，也有大概50人能大致走上去。当然关键时刻还是要来问我几句，尤其企业和Offer选择时。对于他们来说，基础的简历、投递、面试、谈工资、甚至背景调查都不再需要我多指点什么了，他们已经有了悟性和经验。\n\n这步B到A的提升，其中一个较大的难点就是政治斗争，也就是从大家所说的搞人开始。领导突然对你不断打压、领导换了、部门调整、派别斗争、企业被收购、股权要不要买，甚至婚姻、不婚、投资、定居、移民、父母生病、自己养老等，在这B到A的步骤中，都会被考虑。但关键，此时第一个无法突破的就是最常见的那个，“领导为难我，怎么办？”见上图方框中，也是人际关系难以为继的挑战。\n\n说实话这一关，是绕不过去的。假设你才年薪十来万，刚毕业，比如下图学弟学妹，你还可以通过换工作换个单位和领导，侥幸躲得起。但这个50万再往后，无论你是待下来，还是去新部门，或者外部跳到新公司，还是熟人介绍你去履新，哪怕就是家里安排的体制内工作，只要你在上班，你都是绕不过去的。要么你就安心做个不断被欺负的老张、老王、陈阿姨、李大婶，月薪小几千。\n\n有道是“人不犯我，我不犯人”，也有云“害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无”，本文讲下逗号后面的那半句。其实就是当别人找你茬时，你怎么办？本篇属于职场攻防战中的防守篇，很重要，不懂得如何防守，你就不会进攻。\n\n这个难关，我今天先支俩小招，大家具体要认真分析。\n\n在职场中，尤其工资高了后，你可以不挑事，但别人会来找你麻烦，挑你、逗你、麻烦你、劳累你、看不惯你、让你出头，仿佛就见不得你的好、就想给你事情做、让你不得安生立命......这里面让人最难过的有两个常见事情：一，甩锅给你，二摘你的桃。\n\n甩锅，其实就是要你这无缘无故或者风马牛不相及的人，来承担工作中的失责。\n\n越大的公司，因为组织庞大，尽管你身边全是同事，座位一个挨着一个，但越会觉得孤单，因为大公司虽然职责明确，但具体的事情却并没有完全按照分工来，而且分工时的职责也包含模糊地带。\n\n所以，我们在大公司时，会时常在不经意之间就背了锅。以这个“锅”为核心，我们看下在一家公司内，你如何按照时间轴来应对背锅和甩锅。\n\n这里提醒下大家，你入职一家公司，有如下这么四个阶段，各阶段你的侧重点不同。\n\n\n# 阶段一: 3-6个月试用期内\n\n这期间你是新人，任务是转正。你要积极工作，态度诚恳，严格执行流程，但不可改变任何流程，对现有体制和现状也不做任何改变，创新提案也不适合此时提出。\n\n新人在前半年要做的是不犯错误，而绝对不是表现能力。在试用期能力过份出众，会被打压，大家都防着你，反而不利于自己的转正。何况，试用期再怎么表现突出，也不会加薪晋级，因为正常的公司总是给至少入职一年的老员工加薪晋级机会而不给新人。\n\n我们有采购员群友刚入职，他就去更换供应商，这就动了别人的奶酪，然后被老同事算计、查访、盘问了，被领导监控、批评和声东击西了，他还来星球里问为什么别人这么对待他，显得自己很无辜。\n\n采购新人，千万别在试用期更改流程甚至更新供应商名录。其他岗位也类似这个规矩，新人不要挑战规则、改写流程，此时该背锅时就要背锅。适当背锅是应该的，背锅也是我们此时的职责之一。\n\n\n# 阶段二: 转正后到入职12个月\n\n这算作第二个半年，此时会有其他新员工进来，你就成了最年轻的老员工。这期间你可以适当提出不同见解、提交改善提案、对现有流程指出改进建议。\n\n这是给公司和部门增加新意，也为了部门更高效的工作和更轻松应对其他部门的挑衅而服务。这期间你已经转正了，目的就变成了让大多数平级同事以及大小领导都对你认可。所以你的露脸很重要，各种会议上都看到你，你出现频率高了，别人才记得你，来了半年别人当作你是来了几年的人，这就对了。\n\n此间的要点是，只接受领导给你的锅，平级同事的锅一律拒绝，包括带你的师父、组长、队长，此时如果还像试用期一样甩锅给你，就可以不接受了，让他自己承担自己的工作失误和垃圾项目。你也别挑事，但更别主动做接盘侠。\n\n这也是我一直让大家低调度过试用期的原因，一转正你就可以不需要加班了，不需要在老同事之后才下班了，也不需要接受老同事的指派。如果有平级老同事此刻将你当作手下，还跟在你试用期时指使你一样，你大可以直接拒绝。拒绝是有道理的，拒绝就是告诉他你俩平起平坐，让给他知道自己的身份。\n\n\n# 阶段三: 第13-36个月\n\n这就是入职的第2、第3年，这24个月该做的就是一个“秀”字，英文叫做show。你不秀，接下来加薪晋级就轮不到你。\n\n“秀”这里，常见的就是两类员工。\n\nA员工就是“中国人”，传统中国人都是内敛的，怕事的，更怕领导，所以不敢汇报，做10件事只汇报2件事，汇报率20%的样子，原因也包括俗称的“报喜不报忧”。\n\nB类员工则是“印度人”，印度人在工作中，做了2件事，他在工作汇报中说自己10件事在做，且都快大功告成。也就是，印度人的汇报率是500%！\n\n其实就是一个多做还是多说的问题。造一艘航母，比如正常需要5年时间，我们A类人兢兢业业、刻苦加班，最终4年就提前完成了。但是这印度人呢？印度人造了14年都没还每个雏形出来，万般催促之下，印度人终于在第25年时造好了。关键这么长时间的建造过程，人已经换了几批，材料也老化了，设计又过时，所以导致这艘舰艇各种病魔缠身。\n\n按照印度人的方式，造不出好东西，但是可以混世，该项目上的人可以一直说自己在造航空母舰，一直类似摸鱼、吃空饷，25年的建造过程加上后面10年的维修保养时间，足够支撑一个工程师职业生涯的一生。所以，在印度，体制内、大国企、大公司的岗位，肯定是千里挑一的，也就是他们的竞争程度比我们更激烈十倍。他们只有上车才不至于贫穷，这也是他们的行事风格所决定的。\n\n但，即使如此，人家也有我们值得学习的地方。在国际化且人性化的500强大公司中，前5年都是B类人也就是印度人胜出，这些人多说少做，反而容易得到大领导赏识，并优先获得加薪晋级的机会。\n\n而A类也就是中国人，则在后5年胜出，这叫“日久见人心”，也就是大概从第6年开始，公司和大领导才发现了A的好。\n\n这里我们的古话“笑到最后的才是真正的赢家”，以及B印度人都欺骗了我们，因为我们辛勤劳动的人一般也熬不到5年后，可能就熬个3年，还没起色没受到重用就走了。我们A类人需要5年之久才能被发现是金子，但是很难熬过5年。\n\n这等待的时间，就类似做生意的止损期，大多数生意是在止损期比如24个月之内倒闭的。这也正是我让大家赶在第二年第三年开始秀的原因。\n\n“秀”的原则是：吸收保守的A中国人以及浮夸的B印度人之精华，你做10件事，汇报11件即可。说出你在做的对公司有利的10件事，并多说1件，略带泡沫即可。\n\n这个汇报率的精髓，只有那些悟性非常高并在没有关系的情况下就年纪轻轻做了领导的人中才知道。他、她懂得了秀的作用，并且把握了度。\n\n总之，在第13-36个月，你除了会秀、多汇报，如果你不甩锅给别人，则更要注意的是不接别人的锅。此间再有其他平级老员工甩锅给你，你就不是像过去那样拒绝那么简单了，你要骂对方，见一次骂一次，骂个两三次对方就不敢甩锅给你了，就会找其他软柿子去了。\n\n\n# 阶段四: 当你已经入职公司第4个年头开始\n\n无论在前三年中是否获得过加薪晋级的机会，第四年开始你都是老员工了。此时你要做的已经不仅仅是“秀”了，而是“斗”，也即内部斗争。\n\n如何“斗”呢？\n\n非自己所在部门的职责，别不清不楚盲目做好好先生。非自己的工作，别以为举手之劳就轻易做老好人帮人代劳。实际上，你最终会发现，做得多错得多，并且自己背上了很多的锅。\n\n最重要的操作要领就是，甩锅给别人而让对方无从察觉，并在公司老板那里将对方比了下去，你则在下次晋级中升了上去做了对方的领导。\n\n这第四步，实际上就是在甩锅中斗下去。\n\n\n# 总结\n\n总结以上所说的“斗”的核心要义：\n\n * 步骤一，是学会接锅，\n * 步骤二，是清楚识别锅的来历和去处，\n * 步骤三，则是开始不接锅而侧重秀工作业绩，\n * 步骤四，是高明地甩锅出去。\n\n以上从职场四阶段讲解，其实主要谈的是1）不接锅。职场第二个防守策略，叫做2）防摘桃，摘桃就是被别人冒领了军功。这俩看起来小问题，其实也是职场的两大生存之道。\n\n\n# 心得分享\n\n这点我们看下和文的心得。\n\n\n# 和文师兄\n\n题目：职场中如何防止被摘桃？\n\n作者：和文师兄\n\n常言道一分耕耘一分收获，但是在职场中，稍不留神或许就发生“你的十分耕耘，变成他人的十分收获”。\n\n你每天加班累成狗，机灵的TA转换说辞、华丽包装一下，将你的付出成果摇身一变成TA的“功劳”，顺势升职加薪，而你只能蹬眼睛看着，竹篮打水一场空。这就是职场中经常发生的“摘桃子事件”。\n\n现代市场经济的一项基本要求就是分工与协作，只要存在多人共同协作执行一个项目，就极容易发生“摘桃子事件”。因此妥善处理摘桃子事件，既保护自己耕耘成果，又维持同事关系，从某种意义上来讲已成职场必备技能。\n\n那么如何防止被摘桃呢？\n\n# 蜜桃成熟时，切记要当心。\n\n当你在潜心耕耘时，人们往往会对你信任且赞誉有加，但凡你提出需求，相应资源需求都会一应满足，这时你在摘桃人心中就是个工具人，蜜桃成熟之时，就是摘桃人腹黑之时。或以讨论项目进度推进工作、给你分担工作等种种冠冕堂皇的理由，窃取你辛勤耕种的果实。所以在蜜桃成熟之际、高层汇报之际要格外的小心。\n\n我的两次被摘桃都发生在果实成熟之际，且发生在与领导汇报的场景。\n\n第一次被摘桃发生在刚毕业的第1年，摘桃人比我多3年从业经验，老板安排我们一起做品牌前期分析与诊断方案。我天真无邪地把我的成果与他探讨，她仗着比我多几年经验假装成我的老师一样给我指出问题，把报告要过去美其名曰“帮我改报告”。 结果报告发过去几个小时，老板组织头脑风暴会议，他率先拿出报告直接汇报起来，而报告的内容压根就是原封不动我的报告，只是局部调整PPT大小排版做个样子，就这样果实在我眼皮底下被剽窃掉了。\n\n第二次果实被剽窃，发生在毕业第4个年头。此时我已开始独立带项目组做项目了，主导项目咨询、策略、创作等几乎全模块，项目几乎到收尾阶段了，却不料直属领导突然安排一个新领导介入。此人从职位上比我高1级，与我直属领导关系却搞得妥妥的，但其专业上自进公司就没有得到老板认可。\n\n他迫切需要拿到提名状给老板证明能力，分去我一部分创意管理的工作，最后竟提出做项目对接人，这意味着把项目管理的权限挪过去，意图夺取主动权。我当然拒绝，提出项目到了收尾阶段只需他协助把控即可，完全无需安排他做项目对接与管理。随后我直接越过他，找到老板陈述利害，阐述收尾期要保持稳定性，不宜更换项目经理。这一次桃子总算没有落得他人之手。\n\n诚然，职场中有各种各样的摘桃人，摘桃人也有各种各样的方式去摘桃，小桃子偶尔共享一下也无所谓，但是必须建立自己原则与底线，大桃子必须当仁不让。须知“委屈不一定能求全，善良过头就是懦弱”。\n\n那么如何防止被摘桃呢？\n\n# 防止摘桃三步法，掌握主动权，步步为营\n\n前期防范：明确任务分工，责任到人。\n\n第一次被摘桃的原因有很多，但前期避免方案就是任务分解。\n\n通过将大模块任务的颗粒度细化，将颗粒度分解到三级任务、甚至四级任务，并且将任务分工情况制作成表格汇报给老板。如此老板清晰知道任务已经被分解执行，老板更为放心；其次后续汇报便可直接根据分工情况分别做出汇报。既能充分做到协同与分工，又能提高任务效率。\n\n中期主动：动态汇报，先发制人。\n\n当一个商业任务需要执行，领导永远都是关心最终结果，领导压根不关心事情是由谁做的，所以谁率先与领导汇报，领导就会把果实耕耘者与汇报人划上等号，而背后付出的人则是工具人。\n\n我们要做的就是动态汇报，根据项目进展情况阶段性与领到汇报，而非等项目最终结果呈现才汇报，也并非一定是正式汇报会议场景才汇报，可通过茶歇、饭局等一切与领导相处时间简短提及，告知项目进度的同时，也表明你在积极为项目操心，何乐不为。\n\n中后期强势：实事求是，当仁不让。\n\n当果实成熟期，摘桃人光明正大前来摘桃，在内部一定要争取上级、甚至上上级领导的认同，冷静列出来你对项目的贡献、强调当下项目节点非你不可、甚至借助内部团队成员声援；在外部，必要时候要借助外部甲方的力量侧面帮你当说客。\n\n总而言之实事求是，从不同角度突出你工作的重要性与不可或缺性。如此哪怕最终仍因无法协调的政治原因被摘得桃子，也会被高层领导安排一个李子吃，实事求是，一分耕耘一分收获。\n\n防止被摘桃子的方法有很多，最核心的逻辑就是掌握主动权，通过前期明确任务分工，责任到人；中期主动动态汇报，先发制人；中后期强势实事求是，当仁不让。职场如何防止被摘桃？只要牢牢掌控主动权。\n\n以上感谢和文师兄的避免被摘桃的心得建议。\n\n其实对于摘桃，也有方法应对，那就是将计就计，尤其在桃子还未成熟时，有些人来冒领业绩，其实很可能变成烂摊子。加上你不透露核心方法、并给与看不出来的馊主意建议，类似给对方下套了。\n\n大家看《琅琊榜》，誉王一直想夺取他人功绩，想将一开始的太子后来的靖王比下去，并致对手于死地。梅长苏看准了他这个冒功心切的点，不断给誉王出好主意，其实就是下套，将祸患无穷的桃子包装成胜利的果实。最终这誉王在四面楚歌之时，不得不造反，从而走上了不归路。\n\n总之，无论是背锅甩锅，还是后面的不被摘桃、将计就计，今天讲的属于职场技艺部分。古今中外，浩如烟海，各种小说，都是讲这个的，也是我们每个人一辈子在探索的答案。这本不是我的侧重点，我主要写求职技艺。\n\n职场技艺里面最难的就是与人相处，这又牵涉到对象的个人特点、公司情况、行业特征、时代背景。大家平时可以结合自己碰到的人和事，采取不同的防守和进攻的策略。\n\n本篇文章分享到这里，祝大家事业发展顺利！",normalizedContent:"# 序言\n\n我们一直讲求职技巧、跳槽技艺，但是你别忘了，10亿成年人中有差不多2亿人做着稳定的工作，他们是不跳槽的。\n\n所以我们很多体制内群友看着这个跳槽、那个换工作的，感觉很憋屈，因为自己用不到这些知识。其实你是幸运的，你都不用担心被裁员，也不需要跳槽，何其幸哉！\n\n另外8亿人在体制外，但这些所谓工作不稳定的人，某一年换了工作的概率也不过1/10，也就是职场人不是一直在换工作，90%的人当年是不跳槽的，也算稳定。\n\n以上无论体制内外，当我们不换工作时，职场考察你的就是不在于求职技能，而是工作技能，工作技能的核心是你如何很好地待下去。\n\n按照书本知识和常理，“我好好待着，努力做好自己的事情，那么一切就没问题了”......这句话是错的，因为你工作就是与人相处，光埋头做你的事情这是不够的，事情是人做的，也是人让你去做的，你做好后也是交给人。你不去挑事，也会有人来找你的麻烦。\n\n今年我主业退休，赶在退休之年再做几个一对一指导。在春节以来新收的10来个职场徒弟中，也有3位是过去已经指导过的人，他们这是想再拜山门。其实我一般不大乐意接他们，因为指导年薪四五十万再跳七八十万，要比指导20万跳40万难多了。一般都是婉拒。 其实通往职业成功的道路上，无论体制内外，也无论谁，都会碰到不少关口，只是重大关口时，你无所适从，自己又摸不到头脑，确实也难过。就看体制外职业经理人道路，最重要的就是两个时间节点，第一次是从低薪跨越年薪30万。说起来容易做起来难。\n\n过往的职场徒弟来找我，主要就是为了突破这一步，可能他们觉得自己c男c女甚至d男d女，起点很低、现状糟糕，没人指导自己达不成，拿到了offer也不敢入职、不够自信。这一步是坐实b男b女，别试用期被辞退，还多次被裁，仍然会滑下来，台阶无法建立。一般都需要待住12个月有了一年的工资流水，这步才算站稳了。\n\n在走向年薪百万职业经理人的道路上，更难的当然是下一步，此为第二个节点，即40万跳60-80万甚至百万，这是走进a男a女行列。在这一步骤中，我看我过去的职场徒弟，比如每100位，也有大概50人能大致走上去。当然关键时刻还是要来问我几句，尤其企业和offer选择时。对于他们来说，基础的简历、投递、面试、谈工资、甚至背景调查都不再需要我多指点什么了，他们已经有了悟性和经验。\n\n这步b到a的提升，其中一个较大的难点就是政治斗争，也就是从大家所说的搞人开始。领导突然对你不断打压、领导换了、部门调整、派别斗争、企业被收购、股权要不要买，甚至婚姻、不婚、投资、定居、移民、父母生病、自己养老等，在这b到a的步骤中，都会被考虑。但关键，此时第一个无法突破的就是最常见的那个，“领导为难我，怎么办？”见上图方框中，也是人际关系难以为继的挑战。\n\n说实话这一关，是绕不过去的。假设你才年薪十来万，刚毕业，比如下图学弟学妹，你还可以通过换工作换个单位和领导，侥幸躲得起。但这个50万再往后，无论你是待下来，还是去新部门，或者外部跳到新公司，还是熟人介绍你去履新，哪怕就是家里安排的体制内工作，只要你在上班，你都是绕不过去的。要么你就安心做个不断被欺负的老张、老王、陈阿姨、李大婶，月薪小几千。\n\n有道是“人不犯我，我不犯人”，也有云“害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无”，本文讲下逗号后面的那半句。其实就是当别人找你茬时，你怎么办？本篇属于职场攻防战中的防守篇，很重要，不懂得如何防守，你就不会进攻。\n\n这个难关，我今天先支俩小招，大家具体要认真分析。\n\n在职场中，尤其工资高了后，你可以不挑事，但别人会来找你麻烦，挑你、逗你、麻烦你、劳累你、看不惯你、让你出头，仿佛就见不得你的好、就想给你事情做、让你不得安生立命......这里面让人最难过的有两个常见事情：一，甩锅给你，二摘你的桃。\n\n甩锅，其实就是要你这无缘无故或者风马牛不相及的人，来承担工作中的失责。\n\n越大的公司，因为组织庞大，尽管你身边全是同事，座位一个挨着一个，但越会觉得孤单，因为大公司虽然职责明确，但具体的事情却并没有完全按照分工来，而且分工时的职责也包含模糊地带。\n\n所以，我们在大公司时，会时常在不经意之间就背了锅。以这个“锅”为核心，我们看下在一家公司内，你如何按照时间轴来应对背锅和甩锅。\n\n这里提醒下大家，你入职一家公司，有如下这么四个阶段，各阶段你的侧重点不同。\n\n\n# 阶段一: 3-6个月试用期内\n\n这期间你是新人，任务是转正。你要积极工作，态度诚恳，严格执行流程，但不可改变任何流程，对现有体制和现状也不做任何改变，创新提案也不适合此时提出。\n\n新人在前半年要做的是不犯错误，而绝对不是表现能力。在试用期能力过份出众，会被打压，大家都防着你，反而不利于自己的转正。何况，试用期再怎么表现突出，也不会加薪晋级，因为正常的公司总是给至少入职一年的老员工加薪晋级机会而不给新人。\n\n我们有采购员群友刚入职，他就去更换供应商，这就动了别人的奶酪，然后被老同事算计、查访、盘问了，被领导监控、批评和声东击西了，他还来星球里问为什么别人这么对待他，显得自己很无辜。\n\n采购新人，千万别在试用期更改流程甚至更新供应商名录。其他岗位也类似这个规矩，新人不要挑战规则、改写流程，此时该背锅时就要背锅。适当背锅是应该的，背锅也是我们此时的职责之一。\n\n\n# 阶段二: 转正后到入职12个月\n\n这算作第二个半年，此时会有其他新员工进来，你就成了最年轻的老员工。这期间你可以适当提出不同见解、提交改善提案、对现有流程指出改进建议。\n\n这是给公司和部门增加新意，也为了部门更高效的工作和更轻松应对其他部门的挑衅而服务。这期间你已经转正了，目的就变成了让大多数平级同事以及大小领导都对你认可。所以你的露脸很重要，各种会议上都看到你，你出现频率高了，别人才记得你，来了半年别人当作你是来了几年的人，这就对了。\n\n此间的要点是，只接受领导给你的锅，平级同事的锅一律拒绝，包括带你的师父、组长、队长，此时如果还像试用期一样甩锅给你，就可以不接受了，让他自己承担自己的工作失误和垃圾项目。你也别挑事，但更别主动做接盘侠。\n\n这也是我一直让大家低调度过试用期的原因，一转正你就可以不需要加班了，不需要在老同事之后才下班了，也不需要接受老同事的指派。如果有平级老同事此刻将你当作手下，还跟在你试用期时指使你一样，你大可以直接拒绝。拒绝是有道理的，拒绝就是告诉他你俩平起平坐，让给他知道自己的身份。\n\n\n# 阶段三: 第13-36个月\n\n这就是入职的第2、第3年，这24个月该做的就是一个“秀”字，英文叫做show。你不秀，接下来加薪晋级就轮不到你。\n\n“秀”这里，常见的就是两类员工。\n\na员工就是“中国人”，传统中国人都是内敛的，怕事的，更怕领导，所以不敢汇报，做10件事只汇报2件事，汇报率20%的样子，原因也包括俗称的“报喜不报忧”。\n\nb类员工则是“印度人”，印度人在工作中，做了2件事，他在工作汇报中说自己10件事在做，且都快大功告成。也就是，印度人的汇报率是500%！\n\n其实就是一个多做还是多说的问题。造一艘航母，比如正常需要5年时间，我们a类人兢兢业业、刻苦加班，最终4年就提前完成了。但是这印度人呢？印度人造了14年都没还每个雏形出来，万般催促之下，印度人终于在第25年时造好了。关键这么长时间的建造过程，人已经换了几批，材料也老化了，设计又过时，所以导致这艘舰艇各种病魔缠身。\n\n按照印度人的方式，造不出好东西，但是可以混世，该项目上的人可以一直说自己在造航空母舰，一直类似摸鱼、吃空饷，25年的建造过程加上后面10年的维修保养时间，足够支撑一个工程师职业生涯的一生。所以，在印度，体制内、大国企、大公司的岗位，肯定是千里挑一的，也就是他们的竞争程度比我们更激烈十倍。他们只有上车才不至于贫穷，这也是他们的行事风格所决定的。\n\n但，即使如此，人家也有我们值得学习的地方。在国际化且人性化的500强大公司中，前5年都是b类人也就是印度人胜出，这些人多说少做，反而容易得到大领导赏识，并优先获得加薪晋级的机会。\n\n而a类也就是中国人，则在后5年胜出，这叫“日久见人心”，也就是大概从第6年开始，公司和大领导才发现了a的好。\n\n这里我们的古话“笑到最后的才是真正的赢家”，以及b印度人都欺骗了我们，因为我们辛勤劳动的人一般也熬不到5年后，可能就熬个3年，还没起色没受到重用就走了。我们a类人需要5年之久才能被发现是金子，但是很难熬过5年。\n\n这等待的时间，就类似做生意的止损期，大多数生意是在止损期比如24个月之内倒闭的。这也正是我让大家赶在第二年第三年开始秀的原因。\n\n“秀”的原则是：吸收保守的a中国人以及浮夸的b印度人之精华，你做10件事，汇报11件即可。说出你在做的对公司有利的10件事，并多说1件，略带泡沫即可。\n\n这个汇报率的精髓，只有那些悟性非常高并在没有关系的情况下就年纪轻轻做了领导的人中才知道。他、她懂得了秀的作用，并且把握了度。\n\n总之，在第13-36个月，你除了会秀、多汇报，如果你不甩锅给别人，则更要注意的是不接别人的锅。此间再有其他平级老员工甩锅给你，你就不是像过去那样拒绝那么简单了，你要骂对方，见一次骂一次，骂个两三次对方就不敢甩锅给你了，就会找其他软柿子去了。\n\n\n# 阶段四: 当你已经入职公司第4个年头开始\n\n无论在前三年中是否获得过加薪晋级的机会，第四年开始你都是老员工了。此时你要做的已经不仅仅是“秀”了，而是“斗”，也即内部斗争。\n\n如何“斗”呢？\n\n非自己所在部门的职责，别不清不楚盲目做好好先生。非自己的工作，别以为举手之劳就轻易做老好人帮人代劳。实际上，你最终会发现，做得多错得多，并且自己背上了很多的锅。\n\n最重要的操作要领就是，甩锅给别人而让对方无从察觉，并在公司老板那里将对方比了下去，你则在下次晋级中升了上去做了对方的领导。\n\n这第四步，实际上就是在甩锅中斗下去。\n\n\n# 总结\n\n总结以上所说的“斗”的核心要义：\n\n * 步骤一，是学会接锅，\n * 步骤二，是清楚识别锅的来历和去处，\n * 步骤三，则是开始不接锅而侧重秀工作业绩，\n * 步骤四，是高明地甩锅出去。\n\n以上从职场四阶段讲解，其实主要谈的是1）不接锅。职场第二个防守策略，叫做2）防摘桃，摘桃就是被别人冒领了军功。这俩看起来小问题，其实也是职场的两大生存之道。\n\n\n# 心得分享\n\n这点我们看下和文的心得。\n\n\n# 和文师兄\n\n题目：职场中如何防止被摘桃？\n\n作者：和文师兄\n\n常言道一分耕耘一分收获，但是在职场中，稍不留神或许就发生“你的十分耕耘，变成他人的十分收获”。\n\n你每天加班累成狗，机灵的ta转换说辞、华丽包装一下，将你的付出成果摇身一变成ta的“功劳”，顺势升职加薪，而你只能蹬眼睛看着，竹篮打水一场空。这就是职场中经常发生的“摘桃子事件”。\n\n现代市场经济的一项基本要求就是分工与协作，只要存在多人共同协作执行一个项目，就极容易发生“摘桃子事件”。因此妥善处理摘桃子事件，既保护自己耕耘成果，又维持同事关系，从某种意义上来讲已成职场必备技能。\n\n那么如何防止被摘桃呢？\n\n# 蜜桃成熟时，切记要当心。\n\n当你在潜心耕耘时，人们往往会对你信任且赞誉有加，但凡你提出需求，相应资源需求都会一应满足，这时你在摘桃人心中就是个工具人，蜜桃成熟之时，就是摘桃人腹黑之时。或以讨论项目进度推进工作、给你分担工作等种种冠冕堂皇的理由，窃取你辛勤耕种的果实。所以在蜜桃成熟之际、高层汇报之际要格外的小心。\n\n我的两次被摘桃都发生在果实成熟之际，且发生在与领导汇报的场景。\n\n第一次被摘桃发生在刚毕业的第1年，摘桃人比我多3年从业经验，老板安排我们一起做品牌前期分析与诊断方案。我天真无邪地把我的成果与他探讨，她仗着比我多几年经验假装成我的老师一样给我指出问题，把报告要过去美其名曰“帮我改报告”。 结果报告发过去几个小时，老板组织头脑风暴会议，他率先拿出报告直接汇报起来，而报告的内容压根就是原封不动我的报告，只是局部调整ppt大小排版做个样子，就这样果实在我眼皮底下被剽窃掉了。\n\n第二次果实被剽窃，发生在毕业第4个年头。此时我已开始独立带项目组做项目了，主导项目咨询、策略、创作等几乎全模块，项目几乎到收尾阶段了，却不料直属领导突然安排一个新领导介入。此人从职位上比我高1级，与我直属领导关系却搞得妥妥的，但其专业上自进公司就没有得到老板认可。\n\n他迫切需要拿到提名状给老板证明能力，分去我一部分创意管理的工作，最后竟提出做项目对接人，这意味着把项目管理的权限挪过去，意图夺取主动权。我当然拒绝，提出项目到了收尾阶段只需他协助把控即可，完全无需安排他做项目对接与管理。随后我直接越过他，找到老板陈述利害，阐述收尾期要保持稳定性，不宜更换项目经理。这一次桃子总算没有落得他人之手。\n\n诚然，职场中有各种各样的摘桃人，摘桃人也有各种各样的方式去摘桃，小桃子偶尔共享一下也无所谓，但是必须建立自己原则与底线，大桃子必须当仁不让。须知“委屈不一定能求全，善良过头就是懦弱”。\n\n那么如何防止被摘桃呢？\n\n# 防止摘桃三步法，掌握主动权，步步为营\n\n前期防范：明确任务分工，责任到人。\n\n第一次被摘桃的原因有很多，但前期避免方案就是任务分解。\n\n通过将大模块任务的颗粒度细化，将颗粒度分解到三级任务、甚至四级任务，并且将任务分工情况制作成表格汇报给老板。如此老板清晰知道任务已经被分解执行，老板更为放心；其次后续汇报便可直接根据分工情况分别做出汇报。既能充分做到协同与分工，又能提高任务效率。\n\n中期主动：动态汇报，先发制人。\n\n当一个商业任务需要执行，领导永远都是关心最终结果，领导压根不关心事情是由谁做的，所以谁率先与领导汇报，领导就会把果实耕耘者与汇报人划上等号，而背后付出的人则是工具人。\n\n我们要做的就是动态汇报，根据项目进展情况阶段性与领到汇报，而非等项目最终结果呈现才汇报，也并非一定是正式汇报会议场景才汇报，可通过茶歇、饭局等一切与领导相处时间简短提及，告知项目进度的同时，也表明你在积极为项目操心，何乐不为。\n\n中后期强势：实事求是，当仁不让。\n\n当果实成熟期，摘桃人光明正大前来摘桃，在内部一定要争取上级、甚至上上级领导的认同，冷静列出来你对项目的贡献、强调当下项目节点非你不可、甚至借助内部团队成员声援；在外部，必要时候要借助外部甲方的力量侧面帮你当说客。\n\n总而言之实事求是，从不同角度突出你工作的重要性与不可或缺性。如此哪怕最终仍因无法协调的政治原因被摘得桃子，也会被高层领导安排一个李子吃，实事求是，一分耕耘一分收获。\n\n防止被摘桃子的方法有很多，最核心的逻辑就是掌握主动权，通过前期明确任务分工，责任到人；中期主动动态汇报，先发制人；中后期强势实事求是，当仁不让。职场如何防止被摘桃？只要牢牢掌控主动权。\n\n以上感谢和文师兄的避免被摘桃的心得建议。\n\n其实对于摘桃，也有方法应对，那就是将计就计，尤其在桃子还未成熟时，有些人来冒领业绩，其实很可能变成烂摊子。加上你不透露核心方法、并给与看不出来的馊主意建议，类似给对方下套了。\n\n大家看《琅琊榜》，誉王一直想夺取他人功绩，想将一开始的太子后来的靖王比下去，并致对手于死地。梅长苏看准了他这个冒功心切的点，不断给誉王出好主意，其实就是下套，将祸患无穷的桃子包装成胜利的果实。最终这誉王在四面楚歌之时，不得不造反，从而走上了不归路。\n\n总之，无论是背锅甩锅，还是后面的不被摘桃、将计就计，今天讲的属于职场技艺部分。古今中外，浩如烟海，各种小说，都是讲这个的，也是我们每个人一辈子在探索的答案。这本不是我的侧重点，我主要写求职技艺。\n\n职场技艺里面最难的就是与人相处，这又牵涉到对象的个人特点、公司情况、行业特征、时代背景。大家平时可以结合自己碰到的人和事，采取不同的防守和进攻的策略。\n\n本篇文章分享到这里，祝大家事业发展顺利！",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/04/16

序\n\n最近网络上流行“外贸不行”“港口都是闲置的集装箱”“今年经济不景气失业潮要来了”......各位不要信以为真，这是最简单的贩卖焦虑。\n\n我们回到这篇文章《为何每年都是最难就业季？》的时间，那是2018年底，我对当时的前后5年做了一次关于经济行情感知的调查，包括2016、2017、2018、2019和2020年的行情选项。结果你看如下。\n\n\n\n很显然，站在2018年底这个时间点上的人，选择2019年经济行情最糟糕的，是最多的。来到2023年的历史制高点，我们回过头来看，其实在2019、2020、2021、2022、2023甚至2024这六年中，2019年是经济大环境最好的一年。\n\n一直说疫情后的经济活跃度想恢复到2019年时候的水平，大概还需要大半年的时间。确实如此，因为这次春运大概20亿人次出头，2019年春运则超过了30亿人次。其他各项数据综合来看，尤其大多数服务业的产值，也都类似，目前大致恢复到了2019年70-90%的水平。\n\n其实即使没有新冠疫情，2019年也是这五年中行情最好的一年。正如我们站在2023年初，去预测接下来的五年一样。人总是对未发生的事件、世界包括时间充满不确定性，毕竟意外和明天不知道哪个先到来。所以，个人会对接下来1-12个月最担心，因为“迫在眉睫”。在你担心的时候，就有人来利用你的焦虑并进一步加大这样的焦虑。\n\n我是看多了，从我19岁至今44岁，二十五年间每年都被贩卖焦虑，我已经见怪不怪了。大家别当真，每天我们都有群友和星友来报喜，说拿到了一个甚至好几个工资翻倍的Offer，还各种纠结不知道选哪个才好。\n\n闲话不多说，回到我们的求职。\n\n\n# 正文\n\n\n# 渠道一：招聘网\n\n我们知道，投简历四大渠道，第一就是用招聘网站，在智联招聘、前程无忧、猎聘网等招聘门户和APP上，海投简历。这个渠道的入职概率最低，一份简历投递出去，连个水泡都没有。因为这份简历的投递最终能入职的概率，最多1%罢了。\n\n所以，用招聘网站投简历的人，如果不知道海，那就基本找不到工作，至少只能找到很差的工作。因为人家人事从招聘网站上收到的是海量的简历，你求职者个人却不去海投，还拿着职位和公司描述认真细致去研读并精准匹配，你就只能一天投递1-5份简历，你这是数量不对称，也是方法用错了地方。\n\n\n# 渠道二：定点投递\n\n投简历第二个渠道则是列出知名的企业作为你的目标东家，然后通过企业官网、公众号、微博、人事的自媒体发布等所谓的私域流量去投递，这叫定点投递，盯着这么十几家最多几十家定点守株待兔，尤其遇到新出来的岗位立马第一时间下手投递。\n\n定点投递一份简历，最终能入职的概率大概5%，比海投稍有改善，但是很多大公司的官网、公众号等需要反复单独注册账号，还要做各种测试、声明、授权和申请，比较麻烦，职位又没那么多，容易让人产生投递疲劳和厌倦感。\n\n\n# 渠道三：猎头\n\n简历第三投递渠道则是猎头渠道，猎头渠道稍微好一点了，投递一份简历最终能入职的概率增加到了30%上下。可以这么说，如果你同一个月通过3家以上的猎头帮你推荐了各1个岗位，则你至少能获得一份工作机会的概率就提升到了接近100%（理论值是90%）。\n\n猎头渠道的入职概率大幅提高了，甚至是在招聘网站上海投简历的几十倍入职概率。但是不好的地方就是猎头是企业的付费招聘渠道，你入职后企业需要付给猎头大概折合你的月工资的2-3倍的费用作为猎聘相关工作的报酬，这叫猎头费。因为收费较多，所以猎头对求职者比较挑剔。\n\n比如企业要求“本科学历4年工作经验外语良好”，但是猎头的潜意识会修改成这样的要求：“本科（最好知名大学的硕士研究生）以上学历4年（最好6年）以上（相同行业相同岗位）工作经验（且）外语良好（肯定要优秀）（气质佳、家庭稳定、来自大公司）”。\n\n这一看就知道，猎头的要求是超过了企业部门和人事提出的要求，最好达到120%的标准，所以猎头对于求职者比较挑剔，你就类似他挑选来的“高级商品”，最好啥都超过基础要求才好。所以我让大家做的通用型用来海投的简历，碰到猎头，猎头一般都会让你再修改下以跟所面试的岗位更加匹配，这里就可以理解了，见《HR/猎头让我修改简历，究竟要不要修改？》。\n\n\n# 渠道四：内部推荐\n\n求职者投递简历的第四也是最后一个渠道，自然是内部推荐，即通过该公司内部在职工作的员工，投递某个在招岗位，这样的入职概率就继续陡增到了50%以上，原理见这里《猎头帮我推荐了一个工作，我发现我有熟人在里面，我要不要也将简历发给熟人帮我内推？》，推导过程如下图。\n\n\n\n内推的入职概率其精确值在52.8%，我们取个约数50%吧。\n\n所以内推入职的概率更高，但是毕竟你找不到那么多人给你内推。有人说“我朋友多”，关键你这么多朋友所在的单位正好在你找工作的那两个月也在招人的，很少，至少概率比较低。\n\n\n# 小结\n\n综上，其实各个简历投递的渠道，最终能获得的Offer数量都是差不多的，入职概率小的需要海投，入职概率大的投不了几份简历。世间万事，本就如此。\n\n明白了以上简历投递渠道的小结，我做个导图一如下。\n\n\n\n下一个问题就要回到本文的标题了，你说企业招人如何获得人才信息呢？人事（HR）是如何收简历的呢？他们从哪些渠道可以获取适合该职位的简历？这些渠道有没有什么优先级别呢？\n\n正常都认为人事就是从招聘网站上挑简历，其实不然，甚至大错特错。\n\n至少人事也是从以上我们所述的求职者投递简历的四大渠道的接受口，来获得简历。但是，从时间和重要性来说，还有很多简历会早于甚至重要于我们所说的四大渠道。\n\n可以理解的是，在招聘启示通过企业自身官网、招聘网站、猎头、内部招聘群发邮件发出去之前，该岗位会有各种内部人事先知道该岗位在招人或者即将招新人，这就是信息差，也是时间差。\n\n这些人是哪些人呢？我们从重要性也结合影响力大小来排序下，如下能提供简历给HR的渠道，都比我们正常求职者的简历更早到：\n\n 1. 老板的亲戚\n 2. 大领导推荐\n 3. 客户推荐\n 4. 其他部门领导推荐\n 5. 本部门经理推荐\n 6. 本部门员工推荐\n 7. 人事总监推荐\n 8. 辞职老员工二进宫\n 9. 员工内部转岗\n\n这些其实就是主要的关系户，还有小众的关系，比如供应商推荐、配偶随迁、子女继位、行业推荐、董事会安排、政府推荐等等，我们暂且不说，就已经有了9个之多。\n\n体制外因为容易裁员、稳定性不够，所以一般大家也不过多关心体制外的关系户。其实这样忽略他们，是不对的，因为人情社会，关系哪里都有。\n\n费孝通先生在《乡土中国》中已经解释得很清楚，在中国这样一个以个人到家族再扩展到社区的社会网络中，有明显的差序格局，类似每个人都处于自己的格局波浪的中心，但也起伏于其他更多人的波纹之中。\n\n\n\n这有别于西方的几根成一把、几把成一扎、几扎成一捆的捆柴状社会结构，他们对于是否我们团队成员的界限分明，我们则千方百计或者触类旁通总能找到关系人。并且，西洋人强调人人平等，但我们的鄙视链观念更重，有贵贱、亲疏、远近、上下等关系，这就是差序的由来。\n\n其实用到我们招聘中，即使你博士毕业能力再强，去面试国内的体制外公司的某个岗位，你也会让位于比你更早到、住得更近的人，我们是承认“近水楼台先得月”的，并且承认能力强可以被关系强淘汰。\n\n所以，在中国的体制外，哪怕是外企，它也必然是中国的外企，会根植于中国的文化土壤。越是高薪、职位重、责任大的岗位，在体制外越是需要关系。你别把体制外的关系不当作关系，可以这么说，我们职业经理人在当下的中国一旦年薪突破80万之后，你如果一点关系没有或者也没有去建立，那你在这个岗位上是待不长久的甚至连获得面试的机会都没有。\n\n比如第一个，叫老板的亲戚，你人事再牛逼、部门经理哪怕总监再厉害，老板要安排一个人做某个职位，你会有二话或者反对不？显然不会。 随便举例，你看如下这个关系，你能不能看得懂？\n\n\n\n董事长跟CEO都给我们这位小兵群友安排了工作，导致她忙不过来了。但是，老板的女儿跟联席CEO哪个“大”？我想你是分不清的，这俩你选哪个？你能得罪哪一位？\n\n这里有两位CEO，一位董事长兼老板的女儿，这仨以及这三位安排的人，其实就都是老板的人，你都不能得罪，且他们的存在人事总监都难以撼动，人事经理也就假装收个简历做个招聘的流程而已。\n\n再来看2大领导推荐，大领导比如第一个CEO，她推荐的人，你能说三道四或者说不能用不？显然也不能。\n\n后面的关系稍微轻一点，因为这个差序在起作用了，关系的程度越弱，则相对更好招聘和管理，但是再怎么说，从3客户推荐，到4其他部门领导推荐、5本部门经理推荐、6本部门员工推荐，再到7人事总监推荐、8辞职老员工二进宫、9员工内部转岗的人，其关系也总比你一个陌生海投等四大简历投递渠道而来的陌生面试者来得强。实际上一定要说关系程度的话，本文中间小亮的推荐及“其他部门员工内部推荐”这个选项排在真正的第10位。\n\n思维导图继续增加如下。\n\n\n\n大家看下图中红色字体的总结，HR有那么多的简历收集渠道，那么多排在你前面的候选者，此刻你才知道了你能入职目前年薪还不错的岗位，是多么不容易，简直过五关斩百将了。\n\n以上这个图从体制外放到另一个地方，我就不知道如何去表述了，也不敢制表，只怕程度更厉害，不便于描述，你心中有数即可。 最后回答昨天的提问。\n\n\n\n这位群友请猎头推荐职位，没有下文就去询问，哪知道得到猎头的答复是“你之前投过简历了”。这又是一种什么情况呢，“这个该怎么破？？”\n\n回到更大的招聘流程中，如下图，这位群友通过海投根本没获得面试机会，人事自己都将他淘汰了。现在通过猎头再次投递，人事发现你是个老脸色，资质较差，四大职业要素不行，所以继续拒绝，不给他下一步进入部门经理挑选简历或者面试的机会。\n\n\n\n但是他一定要盯着问原因，猎头也很无奈，只用了人事的原话“你在招聘网站上已经投过简历了，（但是你的简历在筛选中就被淘汰人家没看上你）。”但是我们群友不能理解，一直要问个所以然，还要破局。\n\n当然，也有可能人事根本就没看到这份招聘网站上的简历，只是猎头随便胡诌的一个理由。\n\n还有可能是用人部门挑选简历时即上图步骤三中，群友的简历被淘汰了。\n\n勉强的破解方法见下图我的描述，虽然后面的部分不便于明说。\n\n\n\n以上讲了人事和猎头收简历的流程，尤其时间顺序，你也能看到他们招聘流程中的一些弊端，或者你可以提高面试概率和入职概率的地方。但是特别提醒下，通过熟人推荐的工作要放到最后才投递，否则你容易低薪就范，此后还要做好几年后都不好意思离开或者跳槽，因为人情债需要背很多年。\n\n总之，想提高简历投递的效率，首要原则是赶早，二才是海投的海字。有些人简历都还没投递一份，就各种分析猛如虎，这是很难找到好工作的。\n\n最后，祝各位群友和读者事业进步，能有四大求职渠道之外更多的简历投递渠道！\n\nEND",normalizedContent:"# 序\n\n最近网络上流行“外贸不行”“港口都是闲置的集装箱”“今年经济不景气失业潮要来了”......各位不要信以为真，这是最简单的贩卖焦虑。\n\n我们回到这篇文章《为何每年都是最难就业季？》的时间，那是2018年底，我对当时的前后5年做了一次关于经济行情感知的调查，包括2016、2017、2018、2019和2020年的行情选项。结果你看如下。\n\n\n\n很显然，站在2018年底这个时间点上的人，选择2019年经济行情最糟糕的，是最多的。来到2023年的历史制高点，我们回过头来看，其实在2019、2020、2021、2022、2023甚至2024这六年中，2019年是经济大环境最好的一年。\n\n一直说疫情后的经济活跃度想恢复到2019年时候的水平，大概还需要大半年的时间。确实如此，因为这次春运大概20亿人次出头，2019年春运则超过了30亿人次。其他各项数据综合来看，尤其大多数服务业的产值，也都类似，目前大致恢复到了2019年70-90%的水平。\n\n其实即使没有新冠疫情，2019年也是这五年中行情最好的一年。正如我们站在2023年初，去预测接下来的五年一样。人总是对未发生的事件、世界包括时间充满不确定性，毕竟意外和明天不知道哪个先到来。所以，个人会对接下来1-12个月最担心，因为“迫在眉睫”。在你担心的时候，就有人来利用你的焦虑并进一步加大这样的焦虑。\n\n我是看多了，从我19岁至今44岁，二十五年间每年都被贩卖焦虑，我已经见怪不怪了。大家别当真，每天我们都有群友和星友来报喜，说拿到了一个甚至好几个工资翻倍的offer，还各种纠结不知道选哪个才好。\n\n闲话不多说，回到我们的求职。\n\n\n#

通常我们什么苦心于编造辞职理由，是因为怕把关系搞僵硬导致下家的背景调查很难做\n\n> 你试用期内还出去面试，你自己不知道是什么原因？无非是打脸了，刚入职一家新公司就待不下去了，要么突然收到一个更好的面试机会，要么你傻逼了你之前工资谈低了现在后悔了，更可能是新领导不想让你通过试用期，就这几个原因，你不好意思说而已。\n> \n> \n> 你已婚未育，怎么说服对方？你已婚未育，难道还能通过你的辞令这么一说，舌头打一个滚，你就变成未婚未育，或者变成已婚已育生了二胎，还是你这么一说自己就变成了一个男人？\n\n\n过年那三连问，无论是2017、2018的三连问，还是用的2019、2020版的，也不会因为你的巧舌如簧，你就立即岁数倒缩回去了1岁，工资立马翻倍，更不会突然多了个男朋友/女朋友，或者多了套房子和车，等等。\n\n我要说的是，很多人，毕业多年，还在用学生思维，想通过自己的说辞来改变现状，这是过分夸大了后天的主观能动性。怪不得那么多人简历造假。每天加我好友的每10个人中，差不多就有2位是来问“我简历造假但碰到了背景调查，怎么办？”\n\n心得\n\n其实这才是问题的核心，有相关疑问的人大多数是初入社会不久的学生，缺乏与社会现状相适应的思维\n\n好了，言归正传，以上这么多想靠自己的某个说辞来突然改变现状的人，比比皆是，凡夫俗子肯定都有这个诉求，我也在其中。\n\n只是，社会人跟学生的区别就在于，学生靠着想象去假设重新来过，这才“每一步都是最正确的选择”；我们社会人则应该，立足当下现有情况，来逐渐改善并趋于更好。后者是接地气的，前者是踏空的。\n\n当然，也有很多职场人进入社会几年了，还在巨婴阶段，比如加薪，我都写了文章《提出加薪后，领导一般是答应还是拒绝？》了，他尤其她突然想向领导提出加薪，有些甚至新工作还没转正，居然会来问“我怎样向领导提出加薪领导才会给我加薪呢？”有人笃定认为领导肯定会给他加薪，还来问我“怎么说才能证明自己的价值？”\n\n说个屁，想加薪，不是靠自己说的，主要看你待的时间、你的工资跟市场价的背离程度，以及你手中的筹码也就是Offer，更主要的是公司的业绩情况、领导对你价值的认可度，但不是你的说辞。你说你是公司第一大功臣都行，关键领导不会给你加薪，顶多先阳奉阴违再伺机将你扫地出门。\n\n心得\n\n其实这里就一语道破了很多劳动者在资本面前不切实际的幻想，资本的逐利模式注定了很多资本家不会把员工当人看，人家只在乎的是能从你身上如何榨取更多的剩余价值，想靠自己的努力、表现好、多表现几下就获得加薪其实是很天方夜谭的。\n\n\n下面分享下自己的看法，这里涉及到薪资的薪资问题其实是对应的两种情况给的\n\n

正文\n\n回到今天主旨，我们找到新工作，准备向领导辞职，但又不知道说什么理由，总不能说“我找到更好的工作了”，也不能说“我们公司工资太低”，又不能说“我厌倦了目前工作，在这里度日如年”，甚至“我辞职是因为领导你是个人渣”，即使用“我要去看看世界”也不行，因为接下来还要这位领导配合新公司的背景调查。所以，想了各种理由，都觉得不够充分，也不合适。\n\n大家记住如上这个象限图，我再次贴出来，一告诉你这是此类问题的指导原则，二便于你收藏。\n\n你就是个演员，在你提出离职时，你看下我的《辞职，是什么样一个标准流程？》，在某个周末或者周五下班时，或者领导出差时，你发一封电子邮件给领导即可，里面直接写“本人，今天2019年12月15日，向领导和公司申请离职，请批准。”不需要写原因。\n\n穷人才会事先想象各种被问原因、各种怎样解释，我们要做的是不解释。\n\n你要躲避过年三年问，要么你做到工资高房产多子孙多，要么你微笑不回答，要么你继续打牌装作没听见，要么就别见他们，甚至过年别回家。这些才是真正的方法。\n\n总之，辞职信里，是无须明说离职原因的。\n\n接下来，领导会有一半可能通知HR，就开始工作交接和离职手续流程了，签离职单时上面会有个备注，也就是那张表格上的“离职原因”，HR会给你写成“个人原因”。这种就是不需要解释辞职原因，最好。\n\n另一半可能，这位领导会挽留你，挽留有个跟领导的一对一谈话。问题就变成了，提出离职后，领导谈话，问辞职原因，怎么说才好？\n\n如下你看看我这个价格200块的回答，其实价值2千也不止。\n\n\n# 第一原则\n\n领导谈话时，你的原则是“君子一言驷马难追”，千万别领导一红脸一白脸你就被说服不走了，除非答应立马给你加薪50%且你已经大致掌握了1-3个月内跳槽的技能。\n\n\n# 第二原则\n\n第二个原则就是，辞职理由不说主观原因。你最好说你的家庭原因，或者某某“不可抗力”，就是要走，你是无辜辞职，你也想留下。\n\n\n# 原理讲解\n\n我们要向贪官学习部分精华，某贪官贪了几亿，直到被判刑前，他也一直坚持说自己很无辜，这几亿巨资他并不知情，完全不知道，是他老婆贪的，跟他无关，真的，特别无辜。\n\n他那个是解释不通的，但是我们一份工作的取舍，老婆是可以说了算的，甚至丈母娘也可以做主。\n\n“老婆给我安排了个工作”“女朋友的妈妈命令我过去”“表哥开了个公司，家里人都让我过去做副总，实在莫得办法”......大家会了没？你想象下你问十个亲友借钱，各借10万，你试试看，他们一大半会告诉你不借钱给你的客观理由，你现在一学就会了。\n\n用老婆做挡箭牌，这里面有三个常理，领导也认同。\n\n 1. 老婆是女人，女人偶尔不讲道理，这是可以理解的。\n 2. 我听老婆的，因为家庭比工作更重要。\n 3. 我非走不可，因为我疼老婆，老婆是更大的领导，并且她可以不讲道理。\n\n\n# 没老婆的解法\n\n有人说“我没老婆怎么办？用什么理由？”\n\n太笨，没老婆，但你有未婚妻/夫、谈了五年的女/男朋友、丈母娘/公公婆婆，你有父母、哥哥嫂嫂、姐姐姐夫、亲叔叔阿姨，等等，举一反三啊。\n\n还有很多理由，尽量用其他客观原因，比如舅舅开了公司，好几年了，还蛮大，家里需要你加盟舅舅的公司，叔叔是老家的局长，等等，这些都是领导无法挽留的原因。\n\n甚至你说父母家里开着一个餐饮集团，他们老了，有一个住院了，你要回去照看和接手家族生意，你类似你是个小的王思聪，领导就不会拒绝你的辞职理由了。\n\n啥餐饮集团？实际上就是个小摊，你回去后一个月不到，就关了，本来以为要个一年半载的，所以现在又安心回来可以工作了，看，这向新雇主解释离职原因的理由已经有了。具体见这里《“你的离职原因是什么”，该如何回答？》。\n\n不要担心背景调查，你这样说，领导会配合你新东家的背景调查的，再说，背景调查主要是调查那40个调查点，上家领导的评价，改变不了你真实的就业经历，领导的评价并不影响新公司入职，不懂的人会将这一点看得非常重。背调，跟求职全程一样，主要看的是你的城市、学历、毕业年数、目前工资等基本面。\n\n当然，向主管提出离职后，你不需要将自己提出辞职的事，透露给主管和人事之外的任何其他同事，只字不提。你的离职原因，可以放到你离职后有人问你时你口头说，也说客观原因，千万别说下家叫做什么名字，你的下家叫做表哥的公司，实际上下家是你的老婆，或者叫做“家人”，领导和别人都不会为难你，除非没有家人的领导。\n\n提示\n\n在职场上伪装自己真的很重要，一定要记住给这些很模糊很不清晰的回答，泄露过多信息就是自己坑自己\n\n其他不熟悉的同事问你时，你默默一笑即可，你更要笑而不语，别大喇叭自己离职搞得全公司都知道了。\n\n以上主要讲的辞职用什么理由，实际上早就超过了这个范畴。",normalizedContent:"# 序\n\n我们总是问，“我辞职用什么理由？” “我去面试用什么离职原因？” “我行业不对口如何解释？” “我试用期内去面试，怎样解释呢？” “我已婚未育怎么说服对方？”“我没车买房工资不高，过年回家怎么回答亲友的三连问？”......\n\n幽哥腹黑话，点击查看\n\n今天这个问题，也太多人问过了，最近裁员的情况多，但找到新工作的人实际上也不少。本文做一个系统的分析，此后类似问题不再单独解答。\n\n大家看到没有？这种预设前提，也就是预设自己处于一个不利境地，然后被别人询问和刁难，此时你如何通过自己的巧舌如簧来应对，或者将对方一军，或者改变现状呢？\n\n其实方法不在于你的说辞，你的主要矛盾找错了。\n\n幽哥锐评\n\n你要离职所以才辞职，你要一个很好的理由来解释，那你别辞职，继续待着。\n\n你行业不对口已经是既成事实，靠你的嘴来辩解，也无法改变过去你几年的履历，简历造假了，也不能通过背景调查，你还是得实事求是。\n\n> 通常我们什么苦心于编造辞职理由，是因为怕把关系搞僵硬导致下家的背景调查很难做\n\n> 你试用期内还出去面试，你自己不知道是什么原因？无非是打脸了，刚入职一家新公司就待不下去了，要么突然收到一个更好的面试机会，要么你傻逼了你之前工资谈低了现在后悔了，更可能是新领导不想让你通过试用期，就这几个原因，你不好意思说而已。\n> \n> \n> 你已婚未育，怎么说服对方？你已婚未育，难道还能通过你的辞令这么一说，舌头打一个滚，你就变成未婚未育，或者变成已婚已育生了二胎，还是你这么一说自己就变成了一个男人？\n\n\n过年那三连问，无论是2017、2018的三连问，还是用的2019、2020版的，也不会因为你的巧舌如簧，你就立即岁数倒缩回去了1岁，工资立马翻倍，更不会突然多了个男朋友/女朋友，或者多了套房子和车，等等。\n\n我要说的是，很多人，毕业多年，还在用学生思维，想通过自己的说辞来改变现状，这是过分夸大了后天的主观能动性。怪不得那么多人简历造假。每天加我好友的每10个人中，差不多就有2位是来问“我简历造假但碰到了背景调查，怎么办？”\n\n心得\n\n其实这才是问题的核心，有相关疑问的人大多数是初入社会不久的学生，缺乏与社会现状相适应的思维\n\n好了，言归正传，以上这么多想靠自己的某个说辞来突然改变现状的人，比比皆是，凡夫俗子肯定都有这个诉求，我也在其中。\n\n只是，社会人跟学生的区别就在于，学生靠着想象去假设重新来过，这才“每一步都是最正确的选择”；我们社会人则应该，立足当下现有情况，来逐渐改善并趋于更好。后者是接地气的，前者是踏空的。\n\n当然，也有很多职场人进入社会几年了，还在巨婴阶段，比如加薪，我都写了文章《提出加薪后，领导一般是答应还是拒绝？》了，他尤其她突然想向领导提出加薪，有些甚至新工作还没转正，居然会来问“我怎样向领导提出加薪领导才会给我加薪呢？”有人笃定认为领导肯定会给他加薪，还来问我“怎么说才能证明自己的价值？”\n\n说个屁，想加薪，不是靠自己说的，主要看你待的时间、你的工资跟市场价的背离程度，以及你手中的筹码也就是offer，更主要的是公司的业绩情况、领导对你价值的认可度，但不是你的说辞。你说你是公司第一大功臣都行，关键领导不会给你加薪，顶多先阳奉阴违再伺机将你扫地出门。\n\n心得\n\n其实这里就一语道破了很多劳动者在资本面前不切实际的幻想，资本的逐利模式注定了很多资本家不会把员工当人看，人家只在乎的是能从你身上如何榨取更多的剩余价值，想靠自己的努力、表现好、多表现几下就获得加薪其实是很天方夜谭的。\n\n\n下面分享下自己的看法，这里涉及到薪资的薪资问题其实是对应的两种情况给的\n\n

前言\n\n当下进央国企成为热门的选择，真宗的央国企确实很多优点，相比绝大部分私企外企，央国企更稳定、工作更轻松、请假更容易。\n\n但接触很多求职者后，我发现很多人对央国企一窍不通，属于瞎求职。他们有些是海外名校硕士，却仅仅因为目前公司有“国资背景”而甘愿低薪留下；\n\n也有人因为一份国企子子公司的所谓"编制"工作而背井离乡，每天通勤4小时，不辞劳苦，工作6年，在一线城市年薪才10万出头。信息在这个飞速发展的社会显得如此闭塞，我逛遍各大网站，竟然发现有关央国企求职的信息少之又少，几乎无人分享，即使有，也只是鸡汤或皮毛，如蜻蜓点水，隔靴搔痒。\n\n我想这很大原因在于央国企是一个封闭的系统，内部的人不愿意公开分享，外部的人自然无从下手。\n\n本文适用于校招，也适用于社招。看完本文，你能打破信息差，知道央国企的招聘内幕，既能解决自己的求职问题，还能给其他人提供咨询，赚上一笔副业收入。\n\n文章主要内容框架如下，信息量巨大，大家比较急的可以挑选着章节来看。\n\n * 第一部分：从职业发展角度看，哪些人适合进央国企等体制内？\n\n * 第二部分：2分钟快速了解央国企的所有信息（股权、架构、级别等）\n\n * 第三部分：只需10分钟，快速找出当地所有央国企！\n\n * 第四部分：央国企的招聘信息上哪儿找？（附辽迪送邦则招聘管规则）\n\n * 第五部分：央国企招聘要求专业对口么？冷门专业进央国企的秘籍！\n\n * 第六部分：央国企的党建岗位值得去么？（不外传干货）\n\n * 第七部分：社招求职央国企的3大战略（极大提高成功率）\n\n\n# 第一部分：谁适合进国企\n\n从职业发展角度看，哪些人适合进央国企等体制内？\n\n体制内包括公务员、事业单位、央企、国企，只不过公务员事业单位考入概率偏低，还不足以作为一个求职的选项。\n\n根据以往数据统计，央国企求职成功的概率约为公务机关的5倍，是绝大多数人可以触及的选项，所以本文主要讲央国企求职。\n\n虽然本篇是分享央国企求职的干货，但并非号召所有人都来求职央国企。\n\n央国企工作确实很稳定，几乎不用担心裁员，不过基本工资也不算太高。它并非神话，并不适合每个人。\n\n如果你短期内想赚大钱，比如家里母亲因病住院急需钱，或者家里几个弟弟妹妹年纪尚小正嗷嗷待哺，包括有弟弟且家里经济情况不好甚至负债较重家庭的女孩，则此刻的你并不适合进央国企等体制内。\n\n那哪些人适合呢？总结下来:\n\n 1. 家庭条件相对优越\n 2. 追求稳定且野心不大\n 3. 本地人\n 4. 家里有关系和背景\n\n四者占其中一条，则适合。\n\n但如果要具体一些，则以下5类人群更适合进央国企，我们挨个分析。\n\n\n# 1. 宝妈\n\n女性的职业发展相比男性来说，由于生理特点等因素，其实更要侧重追求稳定。\n\n一方面，女性的生理结构意味着女生要和男生竞争，用加班、频繁出差等蛮力并不可取，事业和人生发展，实际上更需要“巧力”。也就是，女性更适合做军师，侧重修炼“管理的艺术"，运营感情、婚姻、家庭和社会工具，并非一定要自己上阵杀敌。大家看《女性35岁学什么技术，未来事业和家庭才更稳定？》。\n\n这里不是说女性不要拼搏事业，而是运筹帷幄反而更能功成名就。\n\n另一方面，男性的职业发展几乎可以不断档，但女性的职业发展普遍呈现一个M形，女性这一生，都要不断经受"家庭与工作再平衡"的心理折磨。\n\n这里也不再展开，因为篇幅所限，且本文并不是探讨女性如何做才能获得更好的职业发展。\n\n大家如果有兴趣可以看这篇文章《女孩如何考虑婚姻和生育，才能获得更好的职业发展？》，这里详细写了女性的一生会经历的3个职业发展阶段，以及每个阶段的侧重点，基本解决了女性职业发展关注的问题，是一篇难得的干货。\n\n接着上文，30-35岁左右的宝妈，普遍来说正在经历怀孕==》孩子上幼儿园，来到了女性职业发展的第二个阶段，这个阶段想要实现工作和事业的平衡几乎不可能，要有所侧重，选择侧重家庭或者工作都可以，总有一方要舍弃。\n\n但如果这阶段是在央国企事业单位公务员等体制内工作，由于工作强度低、工作作息相对合理、请假容易，实际上可以实现工作和事业的相对平衡。\n\n所以，30-35岁的宝妈，尽量争取早点进入央国企等体制内。当然，35岁以上的女性也适合央国企，且央国企对年龄几乎不限制，对于过了考公考编年龄的人来说，是进入体制内为数不多的道路。\n\n\n# 2. 海归群体\n\n海归家庭条件大多尚可，所以海归群体回国后可以优先进大城市的央国企等体制内。\n\n央国企的好处是进可攻退可守，即使你以后想从体制内出来赚高工资，大城市也有足够的职业机会。\n\n因此，海归尤其海归女，更适合进央国企、参与选调生和人才引进。\n\n我最近又重读了您的文章后，决定硕士毕业后还是去上海工作落户。但是看到您有篇文章说过海归女建议首选上海体制内，优于上海体制外，因为好处>体制外高工资。这和您的其他文章里建议家庭不富裕的独生女去大城市高工资体制外的观点又有些许冲突，不知道是否适用于我个人。所以想问一下您，像我这种情况，应该选择上海体制内还是体制外比较合适呢？希望幽哥给些建议，谢谢！\n\n但也不是绝对，海归男进体制的倾向性就比海归女要淡一点，更为重要的，如果你的出国学费大多节衣素食、靠借贷而不是父母家里支持，则更适合大城市的体制外。\n\n当然，几年后经济压力缓解了，还可以再进央国企。所谓进可攻退可守便是如此。\n\n\n# 3. 学历不高的人\n\n如果没有较高学历，只有大专以下的文凭，那在大城市体制外很难施展开拳脚，职业发展后劲不足。\n\n这类人群要想获得较好的职业发展，方向一是提升学历，走大城市体制外的发展路线；\n\n方向二则是进央国企事业单位公务员等体制内。尤其央国企虽然工资不高，但也能有当地中上水平的收入，能够避免成为当地的D男D 女。\n\n可能有些人会说，低学历进国企难啊，进不去！别急，我先卖个关子，文章后面会展开。\n\n低学历进体制内的人很多，我们有很多群友进了央国企等体制内后，才发现隔壁同事大多学历并不高，大专、函授本甚至中专毕业的学弟学妹都不少。存在即合理，你自然也能进去！\n\n当然还有第4类人群，即回老家"二三线城市"工作的独生子或独生女，对这类人群来说，进央国企等体制内几乎可以说是职业发展的最优解…\n\n（以下部分为付费阅读，文章越往后干货越足，信息量越大，意味深长…大家放心食用！）\n\n\n# 4. 回老家“二三线城市”工作的独生子女\n\n独生子女，一般来说能享受家里的全部资源，家庭条件相对优越。\n\n加上二三线城市的体制外工作机会并不多，大型企业较少，体制内和体制外的性价比那叫一个天差地别，完全不同的人生。\n\n再考虑到老家人脉关系、定居难度、生活成本、父母养老等，对独生子女来说，老家“二三线城市"央国企事业单位公务员等体制内的工作算是职业发展的最优解。\n\n但这里的“老家”，也须划个范围，主要包括成都、西安、重庆、武汉、郑州、合肥、昆明、贵阳、济南、苏州、福州等省会和计划单列市等二三线城市。如果你的老家在乡镇、小县城等经济落后地区，那可能就要另当别论了。独生子女，无论大城市还是小城市，职业道路的优先顺序是：【A】老家体制内>【B】大城市体制外高工资>【C】大城市体制内>【D】老家体制外。\n\n但如果独生女家庭并不富裕，比如1）没有出国和考研的机会、2）被父母摁在小城市所谓体制内、3）但这小城市不是家乡、4）父母不支持你买房、5）不允许你去一线城市、6）问独生女儿不断要钱且持续多年、7）不提供陪嫁、8）没收你的彩礼、9）让你盯着有房的男人相亲早点嫁过去……这些同时满足3条以上，相对来说就可以叫做“假独生女”现象。也会有假独生子，比例小一点。\n\n假独生子女，和家里兄弟姐妹一大把的情况，都最好按如下职业选择顺序：【B】大城市体制外>【C】大城市体制内>【A】老家体制内>【D】老家体制外。\n\n所以总结来说，具体选择以上哪一条道路，本质是看你家庭贫富程度：贫穷尽量选择高工资，富裕相对来说可以选择安稳。\n\n很多应届生刚毕业找工作时，比如我当初自己，一般是不清楚自己家庭情况是如何的，容易低估生活压力，以为生活紧一紧，日子也还过得去，直到步入社会开始自己独立生活，自己承担生活费、房租、人情费用、买房等压力时，才开始对自身经济条件有个大概了解，才发现：哦，原来我那么穷。\n\n这是一个逐步认识的过程，如果你也不清楚，给你一个评判的标准：父母若能提供100万以上现金支持你在大城市买房，则你相对富裕，可以选择安稳的职业道路。注：100万是下限，最低要求。\n\n我们群友中在此问题上最“苦”的，算上面有一个姐姐、下面有个弟弟的，其中也有父母年入好几十万的，但父母可以为大姐的购房贡献不少，剩下几套房和数百万现金等家产几乎全给岁数尚小的弟弟，可对这个二女儿却一分不愿意再付出，尤其这个二女儿学历达到研究生时。父母从来不鼓励这个二女儿买房，一旦提及则反复打压，并且列数她当初的读书花了家里多少钱财。\n\n所以，这个“二姐”并不适合进体制内，尽管他们更想躺平。反之，越有托底的人，越适合也越有条件选择进央国企等体制内。\n\n\n# 5. 家里有关系和背景\n\n朝中有人好做官，历朝历代都是如此。如果这句话无法感受甚至不懂，建议看下电视剧《人民的名义》中的祁同伟，即使名校出生，但因为没有关系背景，是如何被打压；在攀上高家大腿、做了金龟婿之后，又是怎样飞黄腾达。\n\n也可以看看电视剧《狂飙》中没关系的李响，与有关系的安欣，在职场中是如何天差地别。\n\n所以如果你有关系有背景，实际上更适合进体制内，也更容易在体制内提拔晋升，获得发展。\n\n如果你属于以上五类人之一，那么恭喜你，你适合走相对安稳的职业道路。\n\n\n# 第二部分：快速了解国企信息\n\n2分钟快速了解央国企的所有信息（股权、架构、级别等）央国企数量多于牛毛。\n\n据不完全统计，全国有46万余家国企，但除了水电烟草等垄断国企，绝大多数是非垄断国企。这些非垄断国企中有大概2/3的正宗国企，福利不错，工作轻松；但也有1/3是渣渣，没有垄断型国企的高薪、稳定，但却有私企的低薪、裁员和996。\n\n所以“如何判断是央企还是国企？”以及“如何判断是正宗真国企还是假国企？"这两个问题对于求职央国企来说是至关重要的。\n\n\n# 1. 如何判断是央企还是国企？\n\n央企和国企的关系，是包含与被包含的关系：所有的央企都是国企，但不是所有的国企都是央企。\n\n那国企、央企如何区分呢？最简单的判断方式是根据国资委控股的种类来判断。\n\n央企是由国务院国资委出资、管理、控股的大型国有企业。\n\n国企是各省市国资委管理或控股的企业。央企数量有限，全国98家，所以想判断一家企业是不是央企，也可以用排除法。央企名单如下，不在名单上，就不是央企。\n\n\n\n98家央企，主要承担国家主要经济命脉的行业，队伍规模大，企业分布广，上升空间大。在央企里工作，最高可以升到正部级，可以交流到地方当省长。\n\n地方国企，则企业规模相对较小，主要集中在市县两级的小型国企，总体上看，发展空间偏小。所以央企相对于国企来说，发展前景、福利待遇等肯定会好一些。\n\n另外，国企的级别越高，对求职者而言越好。因为国资委批准工资总额，是按级别来划分。也就是说只有级别高的国企，才能给得起高工资！\n\n国企子公司同一级别的员工收入永远不会超过国企总部相应级别员工收入，所以找央国企，如果能进总部自然更好。\n\n判断国企的级别，可以分别从横向和纵向比较，\n\n纵向:\n\n横向:\n\n# 判断公司级别的方法\n\n要判断一家国企是总部还是一级子公司还是二级子公司，可以通过看公司官网的组织框架直观了解，如下图。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2. 如何判断是真国企还是假国企？\n\n有求职经验的人肯定会遇到，有些企业把自己包装成“国企”，比如实质是民企，但在招聘网站上挂上国企的标签；比如有些公司有国企参股，尽管占股非常小，但也对外宣称有“国资背景”。\n\n想识破这些套路非常简单：看公司股权结构就可以。\n\n通过企查查等APP就能查询股权。比如下图中，查询到国家电网的股东只有一个，国资委持股100%，说明是个纯度100%的国企，且还是国务院的国资委，说明是个央企。\n\n\n\n\n\n查询股权占比的具体操作可以看这篇文章《如何判断一家公司是不是国企？》。\n\n总结来说：\n\n 1. 国家100%出资的公司就是国有独资公司；\n 2. 如果国家出资比例很高（至少超过51%）就是国有控股公司；\n 3. 如果国家出资比例较低，那就是国有参股公司。\n\n国资委占比越大，国企的纯度越高，越接近真国企，越好。我们求职的目标是大公司，所以最好进国有独资大公司，至少也是国有持股51%以上的控股公司。\n\n上面是通过国资委占股比例来判断真假国企，是通过客观数据。接下来再给大家介绍一种客观觉察法：\n\n 1. 越不好进的国企说明越是好国企。比如电网，烟草等垄断国企很难进，实际上待遇也不错。\n\n 2. 越是好进的国企，一般市场化程度越高，待遇差，且压力大。因为该国企不仅要在国企内竞争，还要和民企竞争。这种属于内卷型的国企，通常打着国企的名号招人，但进去后发现就是一民企。比如某施工类国企。\n\n以上两个方法，客观与感性相结合，在2分钟内能快速判断一家企业是真国企还是假国企。\n\n\n# 第三部分：查找当地国企\n\n只需10分钟，快速找出当地所有国企！\n\n以上第一部分主要解决了“什么人适合进央国企”问题，第二部分主要解决了“如何快速了解一家国企”，接下来，要解决如何进央国企这个问题了。\n\n国企数量众多，各个国企公司的官网、公众号实在太多了，一个个去找未免太麻烦。\n\n有些人在招聘网站上通过设置企业性质去投递简历，又经常会遇到某些企业打着“国企的幌子”来招聘，最后耗费巨大心血，面试通过了才发现，原来是个假国企。\n\n所以，如果你计划进国企，最好在投递简历前先整理好定点投递的“目标企业清单”。\n\n很多人来问我，苏州有哪些国企？济南有哪些国企？其实这些问题不用来问我，我如下教你一招，你很快能自己找到你目标求职城市的所有国企。\n\n如第二部分所属，央国企一般分为央企和国企，98家央企的名单已经帮大家整理好放到上文第二部分了。\n\n现在主要找出你所在城市当地国企名单。一般来说，当地国企又可以分为省级国企和市级国企，这些国企名单同样可以在当地国资委官网找到。\n\n我以江苏省苏州市为例给大家具体演示一遍。大家注意举一反三，找出你所在城市的央国企名单。\n\n百度搜索：江苏省国资委官网，在首页顶栏的“省属企业”里，就能找到省级国企，如下图所示。\n\n\n\n百度搜索：深圳市国资委官网，把首页拉到底部，可以很容易在首页的明显位置找到【企业风采】的展示滚动栏，如下图箭头所示，便是深圳市属国企名单。点击任何一个企业图标，可以链接到该企业的官网，并找到人才招聘的入口。\n\n\n\n如果总部的招聘岗位少你进不去，你还可以找出该国企的下属单位，国企通常是一个很庞大的系统，通常有较多的二级、三级下属子公司。这些下属子公司的名单，你可以通过组织框架找到。\n\n如下图我以中国航天科工为例，通过登陆该央企的官网，找到组织框架，可以顺藤摸瓜牵出一大串的名单。\n\n\n\n通过以上简单的操作就可以收集到工作所在城市的央企+省属国企+市属国企+下属单位，把它们整理成自己定点投递的企业清单里。\n\n除了一线城市这份名单会比较长，二三线城市央国企数量并不多，所以搞定这份名单还是比较轻松的。\n\n定点投递的企业清单整理好之后，我们再看如何投递简历。\n\n\n# 第四部分：国企的招聘信息上哪儿找？\n\n（附招聘潜规则）\n\n\n# 1. 校招渠道\n\n在央国企国招聘中，校招占80%以上，社招不到15%，其他渠道例如人才引进等占5%左右。\n\n所以如果你是应届生，请珍惜这个身份，提前收集好大型央国企的名单，多关注当地牛逼大学的就业信息网站。\n\n应届生进优质央国企的概率还是很大的。但社招的朋友也不要气馁，好歹也有15%，也不是完全不可能，以下几个渠道社招校招都能用。\n\n\n# 2. 熟人内推渠道\n\n通过熟人内推进国企，是最靠谱的方式。尤其是该国企内部的员工，他能够第一时间了解单位里的风吹草动，当有岗位放放出来，能够第一时间内推给你，此时成功率很大。\n\n此外，熟人介绍工作的好处还在于能打破信息差，方便你了解部门真实情况，比如福利待遇、部门氛围、领导是否奇葩等等，这些因素能帮你综合判断offer的好坏，避免摸瞎跳槽。\n\n所以大家若想进央国企，请动用身边的一切资源，包括亲戚朋友、同学、校友……\n\n如果你有亲戚在央国企工作，且职位不低的话，那你在里面工作几乎就是一句话的事了。（这也是为何央国企里的关系户确实很多的原因，仅次于高校，高校因为大力引进人才，所以大部分行政岗位是博士家属，而央国企的关系户，则大多数是单位领导安插进去的亲戚。）\n\n但大多数人并没有这种在央企做大佬的亲戚，怎么办呢？\n\n没有关系，那就创造关系。当地的几个大国企数量不多，可以有意识地去结交他们，并维护好关系。再具体一些可以通过聚会，经朋友介绍认识，通过亲戚引荐认识，甚至在一些国企的班车等候点，也能偶遇“贵人”。\n\n\n# 3. 定点投递\n\n还记得第三部分我们整理好的国企名单吗？接下来我们对照这份名单，逐个打开招聘网站。90%以上的国企现在与时俱进，在前程无忧、智联招聘上已开通账号，另外10%如果找不到的话可以在企业官网去找，去看下当前哪些岗位在招聘，挨个投递即可。\n\n查找公司时有小技巧的，一般你输入①输入企业完整的名称；②输入企业的简称大概率能找到。\n\n比如我以国企苏州交通投资有限麦任公司为例：\n\n①输入完整的企业名称：苏州交通投资有限麦任公司\n\n②输入企业简称：苏州交投\n\n大家掌握这个方法，能极大提高你找到企业的成功概率。\n\n\n# 4. 猎头渠道\n\n国企的一些关键岗位，大多数并非通过传统招聘网站发布。\n\n为何？因为国企的一个好岗位好几千双眼睛盯着，一旦公开发布，各种关系户会打爆电话，那到底是给关系户A还是关系户B？为了都不得罪，国企在社招中招聘一些关键岗位时，通常付费给猎头来寻找候选人。\n\n所以求职央国企，尤其是想获得较好的岗位，你要尤其侧重通过猎头来招聘：通过注册猎聘网，给一些大型猎头公司投递简历，多投递几家，这样你就能调动猎头来给你推荐工作。\n\n\n# 5. 网络渠道海投\n\n如果你不想主动去找，想被动接受招聘信息，那你可以订阅一些公众号。这里推荐大家关注"国资小新"公众号，这是国资委官网认证的一个平台，信息很全面，校招和社招都有。\n\n另外，如果要更精准的招聘信息，比如某个地区的，你可以关注中公教育。有个技巧分享给大家：比如你要找上海的国企、央企、事业单位的招聘信息，你就关注"上海中公教育"公众号。总之就是“省份+中公教育”。\n\n关注后点进去！很神奇，你会发现当地国企央企事业单位等招聘信息全都帮你汇总好了，你只需要标星，时常点进去浏览信息就可以！\n\n当然，网络渠道招聘信息很多都已失效，海投是必须的。如果你失业着急找工作，那就不要挑剔了，找3-5个主流招聘网站：前程无忧、智联招聘、猎聘网等一键投递，先解决失业问题。\n\n\n# 第五部分：国企对专业的要求\n\n国企招聘要求专业对口么？冷门专业进央国企的秘籍！\n\n相对来说，计算机等热门专业进国企相对容易，高水平技术人员、资深工程师、精算师、注册会计师之类的，两个字，不难。求职重灾区在于生化环材等冷门专业。\n\n很多人误认为进央国企肯定得专业对口，这家国企没有我专业对口的岗位，所以我没有机会进去了。\n\n但事实是，央国企的招聘和公务员事业单位并不相同。公务员、事业单位的招聘简章若写了该岗位只有A专业可以报考，你B专业报名该岗位，则99%无法通过资格审查。\n\n但央国企的岗位描述里写招聘A专业的人，你B专业报名也能有很大概率获得offer，也就是这篇文章《岗位不匹配的工作，为何也会录取我？》同样适用于央国企求职。\n\n总之，央国企招聘并非一定要求专业对口，尤其随着你工作年限提高，专业无论是民企外企还是央国企，都越来越不是个事儿。\n\n冷门专业进入央国企的求职思路很简单：投递不限制专业的岗位+适当的相关经验。\n\n相关经验很好理解，主要是简历制作环节，大家多往投递岗位里靠近，即使没有从事相关工作，但了解过、见过其他同事做过、与该岗位的同事交集频繁，都可以写成自己的工作经验，具体看这篇文章《如何求职和面试从没做好的工作？》。\n\n相关工作经验有了，那哪些岗位不限制专业呢？其实除了程序员等技术类岗位，大多数岗位并不限制专业，我稍微举几个例子，大家举一反三。\n\n 1. 人力资源。人力资源部属于国企的重点部门，一般分为人力资源规划、招聘与配置、培训与开发、绩效管理、薪酬管理、劳动关系管理6大模块，以上均不限制专业。\n\n 2. 供应链。包括采购岗、计划岗、物流岗、质量工程师等，以上岗位均不限专业。\n\n 3. 销售/技术支持/技术工程师，均无专业限制，且岗位需求大。虽然幽哥不建议大家做销售，但国企的销售尤其是大客户销售，性价比高，可以尝试。\n\n 4. 电商运营/运营专员。这类岗位属于新兴岗位，因为内部的老员工很少懂这方面，所以只能向外重新招聘，这决定了岗位需求多，要求低，容易进。\n\n 5. 项目经理。很多实业类央国企对这个岗位的需求大，工资不低，且不限制专业。\n\n 6. 党建专员/宣传专员/行政/综合管理/科技管理等。党群工作主要分为两类，一是党建，负责传达中央精神，组织各种党建学习与活动，发展党员等。二是群团工会，主要包括共青团、工会、班组建设等方面的工作。还有一些单位，会把新闻宣传的职能放在党群部，现在国有企业都很注重宣传，分为外宣和内宣，外宣就是联络新闻媒体对企业进行宣传，内宣指的是单位内网、公众号之类的信息平台。当然，做党建专员一般需要党员身份。\n\n以上岗位都不限制专业，大家注意淡化行业和岗位，大胆投递，我们已经有很多群友通过上述方法进去了，国企并没有你想的那么难进！\n\n\n# 第六部分：国企的党建岗位值得去么？\n\n国企党建岗值不值得去？这个问题被问得最多。\n\n大概是因为国企对这个岗位需求多，门槛低，又不限制专业，很多文科类、生化环材大自然保护等冷门专业也能进，是普通人进国企为数不多的机会。\n\n但网上有很多针对该岗位的负面评价，导致很多人对党建这个岗位避之不及。\n\n其实真实情况并非如此。\n\n我自己目前在央企工作，和党群部打交道很多，所以了解一些内部信息，某些情况下的党群工作其实非常值得年轻人去做。\n\n这是因为在国企，一把手通常也是党委书记，在做任何重大事项的决策，包括在干部任用之前，都需要前置到党委审批。而这些年，国有企业在不断探索党建与业务融合，提出"党建引领一切”的主张，所以党群部已逐渐成为国企里的一个核心部门。\n\n之前我在小红书上分享过，国企的党建和人力哪个部门更好，引起20万人围观，获得超3000 个点赞收藏，近1000条评论、转发。\n\n里面我抛出这样一个观点：党群岗位在国企里是最能接近核心人物和核心工作的岗位，且“面子工作”以及“亮点工作”比较多，容易“抛头露面”、出成绩，被大家看到，相对来说升职加薪更容易。\n\n但是评论底下党建人的哭声一片：\n\n网友发言\n\n网友1： 党建就是一天写不完的材料、为难自己+为难别人\n\n网友2：不要接触党建，会变得不幸\n\n网友3：党建能加到你怀疑人生，写资料、编资料、整改资料等等能让你成秃顶！\n\n所以很明显，大多数党建人对这份工作并不满意。但就像几乎每个大学生都不喜欢自己的专业一样，且几乎没有人真的是喜欢工作的，所以基本上每个岗位都会有人说不好。\n\n当然，这里面有一定“幸存者偏差”的因素，也就是说，只有工作干的不好的人，才会出来吐槽，而那些工作干的好，薪水高的人，一般是不会出来张扬的，比较低调，以免因炫耀而飞来横祸。\n\n大家看如下截图中红框圈起的“低调”评论，真知总是容易被雪藏。\n\n评论了你的笔记\n\n6小时前\n\n我09年毕业在事转企的单位做人力，12年开始干党建，从党办副主任（副科）一直到支部书记（正处，副职待遇），回头看如果干人力，目前最多是正科。◎回复评论\n\n所以判断一份工作好不好，很大程度上我们不能靠工作内容、自己的喜好，也不能全听外界一面之词，而应该以公司人数、成立时间、薪酬、是否五天八小时等主要因素来综合评判，\n\n求职央国企时，还应考虑国资委持股比例、是总部还是分公司、直属领导好坏、离家远近、是否外包等，这涉及到offer打分表，大家可以参考《体制内的工作，如何评估？》\n\n\n# 工作Offer打分方法\n\n所以接下来我将给大家分享的3个衡量党建工作好坏的方法，只是选择一个党建offer时的考虑因素，具体还需要配合以上offer打分表评判。\n\n# 第一种判断方法\n\n因为不同国企的综合办公室职责不太一样，有的国企党建部和办公室（党委办公室）合并在一起的，有的是分开。\n\n所以如果是分开的，那我建议你在有选择的情况下优先考虑综合秘书岗。综合秘书岗在领导视线下工作，工作干得好容易被看到。而且站位高，机会也多。但秘书岗确实比较忙，属于一份耕耘一份收获。\n\n但如果是文书、文印等岗位，则相对来说较为边缘，不入领导法眼，但是又确实忙碌，付出与收入不成正比。\n\n# 第二种判断方法\n\n再说第2种方法。按照工作内容和性质分类，党建岗有两种类型，第一种是组织型党建岗，值得去，第二种是基础型党建岗，不值得去。\n\n简单来说，在集团总部或者一级二级国企，党员人数众多（几百人），成立有党委的单位，里面的党建岗位就是组织型。\n\n而另一种是三级四级国企，或者单位里党员人数较少，单位没有党委，只有xx党支部，这种单位里面的党建岗位就是基础型，不值得去\n\n绝大多数处于基础岗位的党建人会觉得很累，写不完的稿子，办不完的会，熬不完的夜，所以他们认为下辈子再选党建就是傻子！但其实并非如此，党建工作也有不同规格。\n\n# 第三种判断方法\n\n还有第3种判断方法。如果一个国企经济效益不好，那你在这家国企干党建，在同事眼里会显得虚浮，包括领导也不会重视，工作也开展难。但如果是经济效益好的国企搞党建，将是锦上添花。\n\n话说回来，其实做基础型岗位并不可怕，因为这种基层的岗位入门门槛低，可以积累经验，为下一次跳入更高平台做准备。\n\n再说，也不是进去之后就一辈子干这个岗位，试用期过后，你可以等待机会内部转岗，比如转业务岗，行政、人事、综合岗等等，这个难度会比你通过外部招聘直接进入小很多，实现曲线救国。\n\n关于党建岗位的职业发展的话，是相对比较窄的，晋升不局限于本部门，还可以被提拔到办公室、纪检监察、人力资源等部门。\n\n原因是这几年国家对国有企业党建空前重视，各个国有企业的党建部门都在扩编，多出来许多中层领导的岗位。\n\n如下是我指导的一个有6年党建经验的学员，目前年薪30万，目标跳槽央企总部，面试邀约接不过来。当然她主要通过猎头渠道找工作。\n\n\n\n大家可以随便找个招聘平台，比如猎聘网，输入党建，可以看到岗位需求不少，且工资给的都不低。\n\n每个国企都有党建岗位，且国企越好，越看重党建工作，岗位空缺越大。\n\n还是那句话，国企党建是普通人进国企为数不多的机会，如果你是党员，且文笔不错，不妨试试。\n\n\n# 第七部分：社招求职央国企的3大战略\n\n掌握可极大提高成功率\n\n\n# 1. 淡化行业和岗位\n\n大家可以参考本文第五部分“冷门专业进央国企的秘籍”，也就是盯着国企空缺较多的岗位投递，而非追求专业对口、岗位对口。\n\n“淡化行业和岗位”法作为幽哥的核心求职策略，想必老群友们都很熟悉了。\n\n不熟悉的读者可以看《中国职场宝典》，这个策略一定得掌握，否则你的职业发展将越走越窄，越走越艰难。\n\n\n# 2. 海投\n\n如果你着急求职，海投意味着你每天投递量要很大，进行密集求职；在职跳槽寻求好机会时，海投则意味着拉长周期，长期伺机而动等待好机会的到来。\n\n大家参考小懒的求职经历《从不上班宝妈到外企年入30万，再跳槽到国企的心路历程》，她的经历有很高的可复制性。\n\n回应文章开头的问题：低学历者如何进入央国企？主要方法就是海投。\n\n在上海某体制内群，群里的都是已上岸体制内的，他周围的同事以高中学历为主，很多居委19岁就上班了。\n\n学历低，也能进体制内！尽管有些单位对学历要求高，但你可以稍稍侧重国企旗下二三级单位的求职。\n\n因为央国企数量多牛毛，就全国来说就有超过46万家国企。\n\n拿实业央企集团举例，虽然只有98家，但这些央企的下属子公司很多。比如中石油的二级子公司就有150家，子公司、孙公司更是数不胜数。如果再延伸到遍布全国的县级、乡镇级的加油站，那就更是个天文的数字。\n\n地方国企则更多，全国每个县至少都有一个国有供电企业，同时也至少有一家国有的污水处理企业，至少有两至三家国有运输企业。各地的公交，省内客运也基本都是国企为龙头在干。\n\n毫不夸张的说，我们生活的方方面面，都有国企的身影。\n\n国企面多量广，就业岗位的总量自然就多。一个县各类国企和各类行政事业单位的用人需求比例大约是5：1。也就是进入央国企比考公考编要容易5倍。\n\n门槛比公务员低，数量又多，加大海投基数，再通过本文第四部分的渠道，你进不了国企都很难。\n\n\n# 3. 曲线救国\n\n如果你尝试了很长时间仍然发现国企正式工的offer很难拿，那不妨退而求其次、先找份事业单位、央国企的非编岗位。\n\n这些非编岗位，有些也能长久甚至做一辈子，且同样工作轻松，时间自由，有些岗位甚至同工同酬。\n\n这些半体制内很适合可以当个跳板，利用工作相对清闲与稳定的优势在职考公考编，或伺机而动找大型央国企的正式员工，实现曲线救国。找非编岗位的具体方法大家看这篇文章《非编岗位如何进去？》。\n\n本文结束，超1万字长文，希望能帮助你求职成功！',normalizedContent:'# 前言\n\n当下进央国企成为热门的选择，真宗的央国企确实很多优点，相比绝大部分私企外企，央国企更稳定、工作更轻松、请假更容易。\n\n但接触很多求职者后，我发现很多人对央国企一窍不通，属于瞎求职。他们有些是海外名校硕士，却仅仅因为目前公司有“国资背景”而甘愿低薪留下；\n\n也有人因为一份国企子子公司的所谓"编制"工作而背井离乡，每天通勤4小时，不辞劳苦，工作6年，在一线城市年薪才10万出头。信息在这个飞速发展的社会显得如此闭塞，我逛遍各大网站，竟然发现有关央国企求职的信息少之又少，几乎无人分享，即使有，也只是鸡汤或皮毛，如蜻蜓点水，隔靴搔痒。\n\n我想这很大原因在于央国企是一个封闭的系统，内部的人不愿意公开分享，外部的人自然无从下手。\n\n本文适用于校招，也适用于社招。看完本文，你能打破信息差，知道央国企的招聘内幕，既能解决自己的求职问题，还能给其他人提供咨询，赚上一笔副业收入。\n\n文章主要内容框架如下，信息量巨大，大家比较急的可以挑选着章节来看。\n\n

第一部分：谁适合进国企\n\n从职业发展角度看，哪些人适合进央国企等体制内？\n\n体制内包括公务员、事业单位、央企、国企，只不过公务员事业单位考入概率偏低，还不足以作为一个求职的选项。\n\n根据以往数据统计，央国企求职成功的概率约为公务机关的5倍，是绝大多数人可以触及的选项，所以本文主要讲央国企求职。\n\n虽然本篇是分享央国企求职的干货，但并非号召所有人都来求职央国企。\n\n央国企工作确实很稳定，几乎不用担心裁员，不过基本工资也不算太高。它并非神话，并不适合每个人。\n\n如果你短期内想赚大钱，比如家里母亲因病住院急需钱，或者家里几个弟弟妹妹年纪尚小正嗷嗷待哺，包括有弟弟且家里经济情况不好甚至负债较重家庭的女孩，则此刻的你并不适合进央国企等体制内。\n\n那哪些人适合呢？总结下来:\n\n 1. 家庭条件相对优越\n 2. 追求稳定且野心不大\n 3. 本地人\n 4. 家里有关系和背景\n\n四者占其中一条，则适合。\n\n但如果要具体一些，则以下5类人群更适合进央国企，我们挨个分析。\n\n\n# 1. 宝妈\n\n女性的职业发展相比男性来说，由于生理特点等因素，其实更要侧重追求稳定。\n\n一方面，女性的生理结构意味着女生要和男生竞争，用加班、频繁出差等蛮力并不可取，事业和人生发展，实际上更需要“巧力”。也就是，女性更适合做军师，侧重修炼“管理的艺术"，运营感情、婚姻、家庭和社会工具，并非一定要自己上阵杀敌。大家看《女性35岁学什么技术，未来事业和家庭才更稳定？》。\n\n这里不是说女性不要拼搏事业，而是运筹帷幄反而更能功成名就。\n\n另一方面，男性的职业发展几乎可以不断档，但女性的职业发展普遍呈现一个m形，女性这一生，都要不断经受"家庭与工作再平衡"的心理折磨。\n\n这里也不再展开，因为篇幅所限，且本文并不是探讨女性如何做才能获得更好的职业发展。\n\n大家如果有兴趣可以看这篇文章《女孩如何考虑婚姻和生育，才能获得更好的职业发展？》，这里详细写了女性的一生会经历的3个职业发展阶段，以及每个阶段的侧重点，基本解决了女性职业发展关注的问题，是一篇难得的干货。\n\n接着上文，30-35岁左右的宝妈，普遍来说正在经历怀孕==》孩子上幼儿园，来到了女性职业发展的第二个阶段，这个阶段想要实现工作和事业的平衡几乎不可能，要有所侧重，选择侧重家庭或者工作都可以，总有一方要舍弃。\n\n但如果这阶段是在央国企事业单位公务员等体制内工作，由于工作强度低、工作作息相对合理、请假容易，实际上可以实现工作和事业的相对平衡。\n\n所以，30-35岁的宝妈，尽量争取早点进入央国企等体制内。当然，35岁以上的女性也适合央国企，且央国企对年龄几乎不限制，对于过了考公考编年龄的人来说，是进入体制内为数不多的道路。\n\n\n# 2. 海归群体\n\n海归家庭条件大多尚可，所以海归群体回国后可以优先进大城市的央国企等体制内。\n\n央国企的好处是进可攻退可守，即使你以后想从体制内出来赚高工资，大城市也有足够的职业机会。\n\n因此，海归尤其海归女，更适合进央国企、参与选调生和人才引进。\n\n我最近又重读了您的文章后，决定硕士毕业后还是去上海工作落户。但是看到您有篇文章说过海归女建议首选上海体制内，优于上海体制外，因为好处>体制外高工资。这和您的其他文章里建议家庭不富裕的独生女去大城市高工资体制外的观点又有些许冲突，不知道是否适用于我个人。所以想问一下您，像我这种情况，应该选择上海体制内还是体制外比较合适呢？希望幽哥给些建议，谢谢！\n\n但也不是绝对，海归男进体制的倾向性就比海归女要淡一点，更为重要的，如果你的出国学费大多节衣素食、靠借贷而不是父母家里支持，则更适合大城市的体制外。\n\n当然，几年后经济压力缓解了，还可以再进央国企。所谓进可攻退可守便是如此。\n\n\n# 3. 学历不高的人\n\n如果没有较高学历，只有大专以下的文凭，那在大城市体制外很难施展开拳脚，职业发展后劲不足。\n\n这类人群要想获得较好的职业发展，方向一是提升学历，走大城市体制外的发展路线；\n\n方向二则是进央国企事业单位公务员等体制内。尤其央国企虽然工资不高，但也能有当地中上水平的收入，能够避免成为当地的d男d 女。\n\n可能有些人会说，低学历进国企难啊，进不去！别急，我先卖个关子，文章后面会展开。\n\n低学历进体制内的人很多，我们有很多群友进了央国企等体制内后，才发现隔壁同事大多学历并不高，大专、函授本甚至中专毕业的学弟学妹都不少。存在即合理，你自然也能进去！\n\n当然还有第4类人群，即回老家"二三线城市"工作的独生子或独生女，对这类人群来说，进央国企等体制内几乎可以说是职业发展的最优解…\n\n（以下部分为付费阅读，文章越往后干货越足，信息量越大，意味深长…大家放心食用！）\n\n\n# 4. 回老家“二三线城市”工作的独生子女\n\n独生子女，一般来说能享受家里的全部资源，家庭条件相对优越。\n\n加上二三线城市的体制外工作机会并不多，大型企业较少，体制内和体制外的性价比那叫一个天差地别，完全不同的人生。\n\n再考虑到老家人脉关系、定居难度、生活成本、父母养老等，对独生子女来说，老家“二三线城市"央国企事业单位公务员等体制内的工作算是职业发展的最优解。\n\n但这里的“老家”，也须划个范围，主要包括成都、西安、重庆、武汉、郑州、合肥、昆明、贵阳、济南、苏州、福州等省会和计划单列市等二三线城市。如果你的老家在乡镇、小县城等经济落后地区，那可能就要另当别论了。独生子女，无论大城市还是小城市，职业道路的优先顺序是：【a】老家体制内>【b】大城市体制外高工资>【c】大城市体制内>【d】老家体制外。\n\n但如果独生女家庭并不富裕，比如1）没有出国和考研的机会、2）被父母摁在小城市所谓体制内、3）但这小城市不是家乡、4）父母不支持你买房、5）不允许你去一线城市、6）问独生女儿不断要钱且持续多年、7）不提供陪嫁、8）没收你的彩礼、9）让你盯着有房的男人相亲早点嫁过去……这些同时满足3条以上，相对来说就可以叫做“假独生女”现象。也会有假独生子，比例小一点。\n\n假独生子女，和家里兄弟姐妹一大把的情况，都最好按如下职业选择顺序：【b】大城市体制外>【c】大城市体制内>【a】老家体制内>【d】老家体制外。\n\n所以总结来说，具体选择以上哪一条道路，本质是看你家庭贫富程度：贫穷尽量选择高工资，富裕相对来说可以选择安稳。\n\n很多应届生刚毕业找工作时，比如我当初自己，一般是不清楚自己家庭情况是如何的，容易低估生活压力，以为生活紧一紧，日子也还过得去，直到步入社会开始自己独立生活，自己承担生活费、房租、人情费用、买房等压力时，才开始对自身经济条件有个大概了解，才发现：哦，原来我那么穷。\n\n这是一个逐步认识的过程，如果你也不清楚，给你一个评判的标准：父母若能提供100万以上现金支持你在大城市买房，则你相对富裕，可以选择安稳的职业道路。注：100万是下限，最低要求。\n\n我们群友中在此问题上最“苦”的，算上面有一个姐姐、下面有个弟弟的，其中也有父母年入好几十万的，但父母可以为大姐的购房贡献不少，剩下几套房和数百万现金等家产几乎全给岁数尚小的弟弟，可对这个二女儿却一分不愿意再付出，尤其这个二女儿学历达到研究生时。父母从来不鼓励这个二女儿买房，一旦提及则反复打压，并且列数她当初的读书花了家里多少钱财。\n\n所以，这个“二姐”并不适合进体制内，尽管他们更想躺平。反之，越有托底的人，越适合也越有条件选择进央国企等体制内。\n\n\n# 5. 家里有关系和背景\n\n朝中有人好做官，历朝历代都是如此。如果这句话无法感受甚至不懂，建议看下电视剧《人民的名义》中的祁同伟，即使名校出生，但因为没有关系背景，是如何被打压；在攀上高家大腿、做了金龟婿之后，又是怎样飞黄腾达。\n\n也可以看看电视剧《狂飙》中没关系的李响，与有关系的安欣，在职场中是如何天差地别。\n\n所以如果你有关系有背景，实际上更适合进体制内，也更容易在体制内提拔晋升，获得发展。\n\n如果你属于以上五类人之一，那么恭喜你，你适合走相对安稳的职业道路。\n\n\n# 第二部分：快速了解国企信息\n\n2分钟快速了解央国企的所有信息（股权、架构、级别等）央国企数量多于牛毛。\n\n据不完全统计，全国有46万余家国企，但除了水电烟草等垄断国企，绝大多数是非垄断国企。这些非垄断国企中有大概2/3的正宗国企，福利不错，工作轻松；但也有1/3是渣渣，没有垄断型国企的高薪、稳定，但却有私企的低薪、裁员和996。\n\n所以“如何判断是央企还是国企？”以及“如何判断是正宗真国企还是假国企？"这两个问题对于求职央国企来说是至关重要的。\n\n\n# 1. 如何判断是央企还是国企？\n\n央企和国企的关系，是包含与被包含的关系：所有的央企都是国企，但不是所有的国企都是央企。\n\n那国企、央企如何区分呢？最简单的判断方式是根据国资委控股的种类来判断。\n\n央企是由国务院国资委出资、管理、控股的大型国有企业。\n\n国企是各省市国资委管理或控股的企业。央企数量有限，全国98家，所以想判断一家企业是不是央企，也可以用排除法。央企名单如下，不在名单上，就不是央企。\n\n\n\n98家央企，主要承担国家主要经济命脉的行业，队伍规模大，企业分布广，上升空间大。在央企里工作，最高可以升到正部级，可以交流到地方当省长。\n\n地方国企，则企业规模相对较小，主要集中在市县两级的小型国企，总体上看，发展空间偏小。所以央企相对于国企来说，发展前景、福利待遇等肯定会好一些。\n\n另外，国企的级别越高，对求职者而言越好。因为国资委批准工资总额，是按级别来划分。也就是说只有级别高的国企，才能给得起高工资！\n\n国企子公司同一级别的员工收入永远不会超过国企总部相应级别员工收入，所以找央国企，如果能进总部自然更好。\n\n判断国企的级别，可以分别从横向和纵向比较，\n\n纵向:\n\n横向:\n\n# 判断公司级别的方法\n\n要判断一家国企是总部还是一级子公司还是二级子公司，可以通过看公司官网的组织框架直观了解，如下图。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2. 如何判断是真国企还是假国企？\n\n有求职经验的人肯定会遇到，有些企业把自己包装成“国企”，比如实质是民企，但在招聘网站上挂上国企的标签；比如有些公司有国企参股，尽管占股非常小，但也对外宣称有“国资背景”。\n\n想识破这些套路非常简单：看公司股权结构就可以。\n\n通过企查查等app就能查询股权。比如下图中，查询到国家电网的股东只有一个，国资委持股100%，说明是个纯度100%的国企，且还是国务院的国资委，说明是个央企。\n\n\n\n\n\n查询股权占比的具体操作可以看这篇文章《如何判断一家公司是不是国企？》。\n\n总结来说：\n\n 1. 国家100%出资的公司就是国有独资公司；\n 2. 如果国家出资比例很高（至少超过51%）就是国有控股公司；\n 3. 如果国家出资比例较低，那就是国有参股公司。\n\n国资委占比越大，国企的纯度越高，越接近真国企，越好。我们求职的目标是大公司，所以最好进国有独资大公司，至少也是国有持股51%以上的控股公司。\n\n上面是通过国资委占股比例来判断真假国企，是通过客观数据。接下来再给大家介绍一种客观觉察法：\n\n 1. 越不好进的国企说明越是好国企。比如电网，烟草等垄断国企很难进，实际上待遇也不错。\n\n 2. 越是好进的国企，一般市场化程度越高，待遇差，且压力大。因为该国企不仅要在国企内竞争，还要和民企竞争。这种属于内卷型的国企，通常打着国企的名号招人，但进去后发现就是一民企。比如某施工类国企。\n\n以上两个方法，客观与感性相结合，在2分钟内能快速判断一家企业是真国企还是假国企。\n\n\n# 第三部分：查找当地国企\n\n只需10分钟，快速找出当地所有国企！\n\n以上第一部分主要解决了“什么人适合进央国企”问题，第二部分主要解决了“如何快速了解一家国企”，接下来，要解决如何进央国企这个问题了。\n\n国企数量众多，各个国企公司的官网、公众号实在太多了，一个个去找未免太麻烦。\n\n有些人在招聘网站上通过设置企业性质去投递简历，又经常会遇到某些企业打着“国企的幌子”来招聘，最后耗费巨大心血，面试通过了才发现，原来是个假国企。\n\n所以，如果你计划进国企，最好在投递简历前先整理好定点投递的“目标企业清单”。\n\n很多人来问我，苏州有哪些国企？济南有哪些国企？其实这些问题不用来问我，我如下教你一招，你很快能自己找到你目标求职城市的所有国企。\n\n如第二部分所属，央国企一般分为央企和国企，98家央企的名单已经帮大家整理好放到上文第二部分了。\n\n现在主要找出你所在城市当地国企名单。一般来说，当地国企又可以分为省级国企和市级国企，这些国企名单同样可以在当地国资委官网找到。\n\n我以江苏省苏州市为例给大家具体演示一遍。大家注意举一反三，找出你所在城市的央国企名单。\n\n百度搜索：江苏省国资委官网，在首页顶栏的“省属企业”里，就能找到省级国企，如下图所示。\n\n\n\n百度搜索：深圳市国资委官网，把首页拉到底部，可以很容易在首页的明显位置找到【企业风采】的展示滚动栏，如下图箭头所示，便是深圳市属国企名单。点击任何一个企业图标，可以链接到该企业的官网，并找到人才招聘的入口。\n\n\n\n如果总部的招聘岗位少你进不去，你还可以找出该国企的下属单位，国企通常是一个很庞大的系统，通常有较多的二级、三级下属子公司。这些下属子公司的名单，你可以通过组织框架找到。\n\n如下图我以中国航天科工为例，通过登陆该央企的官网，找到组织框架，可以顺藤摸瓜牵出一大串的名单。\n\n\n\n通过以上简单的操作就可以收集到工作所在城市的央企+省属国企+市属国企+下属单位，把它们整理成自己定点投递的企业清单里。\n\n除了一线城市这份名单会比较长，二三线城市央国企数量并不多，所以搞定这份名单还是比较轻松的。\n\n定点投递的企业清单整理好之后，我们再看如何投递简历。\n\n\n# 第四部分：国企的招聘信息上哪儿找？\n\n（附招聘潜规则）\n\n\n# 1. 校招渠道\n\n在央国企国招聘中，校招占80%以上，社招不到15%，其他渠道例如人才引进等占5%左右。\n\n所以如果你是应届生，请珍惜这个身份，提前收集好大型央国企的名单，多关注当地牛逼大学的就业信息网站。\n\n应届生进优质央国企的概率还是很大的。但社招的朋友也不要气馁，好歹也有15%，也不是完全不可能，以下几个渠道社招校招都能用。\n\n\n# 2. 熟人内推渠道\n\n通过熟人内推进国企，是最靠谱的方式。尤其是该国企内部的员工，他能够第一时间了解单位里的风吹草动，当有岗位放放出来，能够第一时间内推给你，此时成功率很大。\n\n此外，熟人介绍工作的好处还在于能打破信息差，方便你了解部门真实情况，比如福利待遇、部门氛围、领导是否奇葩等等，这些因素能帮你综合判断offer的好坏，避免摸瞎跳槽。\n\n所以大家若想进央国企，请动用身边的一切资源，包括亲戚朋友、同学、校友……\n\n如果你有亲戚在央国企工作，且职位不低的话，那你在里面工作几乎就是一句话的事了。（这也是为何央国企里的关系户确实很多的原因，仅次于高校，高校因为大力引进人才，所以大部分行政岗位是博士家属，而央国企的关系户，则大多数是单位领导安插进去的亲戚。）\n\n但大多数人并没有这种在央企做大佬的亲戚，怎么办呢？\n\n没有关系，那就创造关系。当地的几个大国企数量不多，可以有意识地去结交他们，并维护好关系。再具体一些可以通过聚会，经朋友介绍认识，通过亲戚引荐认识，甚至在一些国企的班车等候点，也能偶遇“贵人”。\n\n\n# 3. 定点投递\n\n还记得第三部分我们整理好的国企名单吗？接下来我们对照这份名单，逐个打开招聘网站。90%以上的国企现在与时俱进，在前程无忧、智联招聘上已开通账号，另外10%如果找不到的话可以在企业官网去找，去看下当前哪些岗位在招聘，挨个投递即可。\n\n查找公司时有小技巧的，一般你输入①输入企业完整的名称；②输入企业的简称大概率能找到。\n\n比如我以国企苏州交通投资有限麦任公司为例：\n\n①输入完整的企业名称：苏州交通投资有限麦任公司\n\n②输入企业简称：苏州交投\n\n大家掌握这个方法，能极大提高你找到企业的成功概率。\n\n\n# 4. 猎头渠道\n\n国企的一些关键岗位，大多数并非通过传统招聘网站发布。\n\n为何？因为国企的一个好岗位好几千双眼睛盯着，一旦公开发布，各种关系户会打爆电话，那到底是给关系户a还是关系户b？为了都不得罪，国企在社招中招聘一些关键岗位时，通常付费给猎头来寻找候选人。\n\n所以求职央国企，尤其是想获得较好的岗位，你要尤其侧重通过猎头来招聘：通过注册猎聘网，给一些大型猎头公司投递简历，多投递几家，这样你就能调动猎头来给你推荐工作。\n\n\n# 5. 网络渠道海投\n\n如果你不想主动去找，想被动接受招聘信息，那你可以订阅一些公众号。这里推荐大家关注"国资小新"公众号，这是国资委官网认证的一个平台，信息很全面，校招和社招都有。\n\n另外，如果要更精准的招聘信息，比如某个地区的，你可以关注中公教育。有个技巧分享给大家：比如你要找上海的国企、央企、事业单位的招聘信息，你就关注"上海中公教育"公众号。总之就是“省份+中公教育”。\n\n关注后点进去！很神奇，你会发现当地国企央企事业单位等招聘信息全都帮你汇总好了，你只需要标星，时常点进去浏览信息就可以！\n\n当然，网络渠道招聘信息很多都已失效，海投是必须的。如果你失业着急找工作，那就不要挑剔了，找3-5个主流招聘网站：前程无忧、智联招聘、猎聘网等一键投递，先解决失业问题。\n\n\n# 第五部分：国企对专业的要求\n\n国企招聘要求专业对口么？冷门专业进央国企的秘籍！\n\n相对来说，计算机等热门专业进国企相对容易，高水平技术人员、资深工程师、精算师、注册会计师之类的，两个字，不难。求职重灾区在于生化环材等冷门专业。\n\n很多人误认为进央国企肯定得专业对口，这家国企没有我专业对口的岗位，所以我没有机会进去了。\n\n但事实是，央国企的招聘和公务员事业单位并不相同。公务员、事业单位的招聘简章若写了该岗位只有a专业可以报考，你b专业报名该岗位，则99%无法通过资格审查。\n\n但央国企的岗位描述里写招聘a专业的人，你b专业报名也能有很大概率获得offer，也就是这篇文章《岗位不匹配的工作，为何也会录取我？》同样适用于央国企求职。\n\n总之，央国企招聘并非一定要求专业对口，尤其随着你工作年限提高，专业无论是民企外企还是央国企，都越来越不是个事儿。\n\n冷门专业进入央国企的求职思路很简单：投递不限制专业的岗位+适当的相关经验。\n\n相关经验很好理解，主要是简历制作环节，大家多往投递岗位里靠近，即使没有从事相关工作，但了解过、见过其他同事做过、与该岗位的同事交集频繁，都可以写成自己的工作经验，具体看这篇文章《如何求职和面试从没做好的工作？》。\n\n相关工作经验有了，那哪些岗位不限制专业呢？其实除了程序员等技术类岗位，大多数岗位并不限制专业，我稍微举几个例子，大家举一反三。\n\n 1. 人力资源。人力资源部属于国企的重点部门，一般分为人力资源规划、招聘与配置、培训与开发、绩效管理、薪酬管理、劳动关系管理6大模块，以上均不限制专业。\n\n 2. 供应链。包括采购岗、计划岗、物流岗、质量工程师等，以上岗位均不限专业。\n\n 3. 销售/技术支持/技术工程师，均无专业限制，且岗位需求大。虽然幽哥不建议大家做销售，但国企的销售尤其是大客户销售，性价比高，可以尝试。\n\n 4. 电商运营/运营专员。这类岗位属于新兴岗位，因为内部的老员工很少懂这方面，所以只能向外重新招聘，这决定了岗位需求多，要求低，容易进。\n\n 5. 项目经理。很多实业类央国企对这个岗位的需求大，工资不低，且不限制专业。\n\n 6. 党建专员/宣传专员/行政/综合管理/科技管理等。党群工作主要分为两类，一是党建，负责传达中央精神，组织各种党建学习与活动，发展党员等。二是群团工会，主要包括共青团、工会、班组建设等方面的工作。还有一些单位，会把新闻宣传的职能放在党群部，现在国有企业都很注重宣传，分为外宣和内宣，外宣就是联络新闻媒体对企业进行宣传，内宣指的是单位内网、公众号之类的信息平台。当然，做党建专员一般需要党员身份。\n\n以上岗位都不限制专业，大家注意淡化行业和岗位，大胆投递，我们已经有很多群友通过上述方法进去了，国企并没有你想的那么难进！\n\n\n# 第六部分：国企的党建岗位值得去么？\n\n国企党建岗值不值得去？这个问题被问得最多。\n\n大概是因为国企对这个岗位需求多，门槛低，又不限制专业，很多文科类、生化环材大自然保护等冷门专业也能进，是普通人进国企为数不多的机会。\n\n但网上有很多针对该岗位的负面评价，导致很多人对党建这个岗位避之不及。\n\n其实真实情况并非如此。\n\n我自己目前在央企工作，和党群部打交道很多，所以了解一些内部信息，某些情况下的党群工作其实非常值得年轻人去做。\n\n这是因为在国企，一把手通常也是党委书记，在做任何重大事项的决策，包括在干部任用之前，都需要前置到党委审批。而这些年，国有企业在不断探索党建与业务融合，提出"党建引领一切”的主张，所以党群部已逐渐成为国企里的一个核心部门。\n\n之前我在小红书上分享过，国企的党建和人力哪个部门更好，引起20万人围观，获得超3000 个点赞收藏，近1000条评论、转发。\n\n里面我抛出这样一个观点：党群岗位在国企里是最能接近核心人物和核心工作的岗位，且“面子工作”以及“亮点工作”比较多，容易“抛头露面”、出成绩，被大家看到，相对来说升职加薪更容易。\n\n但是评论底下党建人的哭声一片：\n\n网友发言\n\n网友1： 党建就是一天写不完的材料、为难自己+为难别人\n\n网友2：不要接触党建，会变得不幸\n\n网友3：党建能加到你怀疑人生，写资料、编资料、整改资料等等能让你成秃顶！\n\n所以很明显，大多数党建人对这份工作并不满意。但就像几乎每个大学生都不喜欢自己的专业一样，且几乎没有人真的是喜欢工作的，所以基本上每个岗位都会有人说不好。\n\n当然，这里面有一定“幸存者偏差”的因素，也就是说，只有工作干的不好的人，才会出来吐槽，而那些工作干的好，薪水高的人，一般是不会出来张扬的，比较低调，以免因炫耀而飞来横祸。\n\n大家看如下截图中红框圈起的“低调”评论，真知总是容易被雪藏。\n\n评论了你的笔记\n\n6小时前\n\n我09年毕业在事转企的单位做人力，12年开始干党建，从党办副主任（副科）一直到支部书记（正处，副职待遇），回头看如果干人力，目前最多是正科。◎回复评论\n\n所以判断一份工作好不好，很大程度上我们不能靠工作内容、自己的喜好，也不能全听外界一面之词，而应该以公司人数、成立时间、薪酬、是否五天八小时等主要因素来综合评判，\n\n求职央国企时，还应考虑国资委持股比例、是总部还是分公司、直属领导好坏、离家远近、是否外包等，这涉及到offer打分表，大家可以参考《体制内的工作，如何评估？》\n\n\n# 工作offer打分方法\n\n所以接下来我将给大家分享的3个衡量党建工作好坏的方法，只是选择一个党建offer时的考虑因素，具体还需要配合以上offer打分表评判。\n\n# 第一种判断方法\n\n因为不同国企的综合办公室职责不太一样，有的国企党建部和办公室（党委办公室）合并在一起的，有的是分开。\n\n所以如果是分开的，那我建议你在有选择的情况下优先考虑综合秘书岗。综合秘书岗在领导视线下工作，工作干得好容易被看到。而且站位高，机会也多。但秘书岗确实比较忙，属于一份耕耘一份收获。\n\n但如果是文书、文印等岗位，则相对来说较为边缘，不入领导法眼，但是又确实忙碌，付出与收入不成正比。\n\n# 第二种判断方法\n\n再说第2种方法。按照工作内容和性质分类，党建岗有两种类型，第一种是组织型党建岗，值得去，第二种是基础型党建岗，不值得去。\n\n简单来说，在集团总部或者一级二级国企，党员人数众多（几百人），成立有党委的单位，里面的党建岗位就是组织型。\n\n而另一种是三级四级国企，或者单位里党员人数较少，单位没有党委，只有xx党支部，这种单位里面的党建岗位就是基础型，不值得去\n\n绝大多数处于基础岗位的党建人会觉得很累，写不完的稿子，办不完的会，熬不完的夜，所以他们认为下辈子再选党建就是傻子！但其实并非如此，党建工作也有不同规格。\n\n# 第三种判断方法\n\n还有第3种判断方法。如果一个国企经济效益不好，那你在这家国企干党建，在同事眼里会显得虚浮，包括领导也不会重视，工作也开展难。但如果是经济效益好的国企搞党建，将是锦上添花。\n\n话说回来，其实做基础型岗位并不可怕，因为这种基层的岗位入门门槛低，可以积累经验，为下一次跳入更高平台做准备。\n\n再说，也不是进去之后就一辈子干这个岗位，试用期过后，你可以等待机会内部转岗，比如转业务岗，行政、人事、综合岗等等，这个难度会比你通过外部招聘直接进入小很多，实现曲线救国。\n\n关于党建岗位的职业发展的话，是相对比较窄的，晋升不局限于本部门，还可以被提拔到办公室、纪检监察、人力资源等部门。\n\n原因是这几年国家对国有企业党建空前重视，各个国有企业的党建部门都在扩编，多出来许多中层领导的岗位。\n\n如下是我指导的一个有6年党建经验的学员，目前年薪30万，目标跳槽央企总部，面试邀约接不过来。当然她主要通过猎头渠道找工作。\n\n\n\n大家可以随便找个招聘平台，比如猎聘网，输入党建，可以看到岗位需求不少，且工资给的都不低。\n\n每个国企都有党建岗位，且国企越好，越看重党建工作，岗位空缺越大。\n\n还是那句话，国企党建是普通人进国企为数不多的机会，如果你是党员，且文笔不错，不妨试试。\n\n\n# 第七部分：社招求职央国企的3大战略\n\n掌握可极大提高成功率\n\n\n# 1. 淡化行业和岗位\n\n大家可以参考本文第五部分“冷门专业进央国企的秘籍”，也就是盯着国企空缺较多的岗位投递，而非追求专业对口、岗位对口。\n\n“淡化行业和岗位”法作为幽哥的核心求职策略，想必老群友们都很熟悉了。\n\n不熟悉的读者可以看《中国职场宝典》，这个策略一定得掌握，否则你的职业发展将越走越窄，越走越艰难。\n\n\n# 2. 海投\n\n如果你着急求职，海投意味着你每天投递量要很大，进行密集求职；在职跳槽寻求好机会时，海投则意味着拉长周期，长期伺机而动等待好机会的到来。\n\n大家参考小懒的求职经历《从不上班宝妈到外企年入30万，再跳槽到国企的心路历程》，她的经历有很高的可复制性。\n\n回应文章开头的问题：低学历者如何进入央国企？主要方法就是海投。\n\n在上海某体制内群，群里的都是已上岸体制内的，他周围的同事以高中学历为主，很多居委19岁就上班了。\n\n学历低，也能进体制内！尽管有些单位对学历要求高，但你可以稍稍侧重国企旗下二三级单位的求职。\n\n因为央国企数量多牛毛，就全国来说就有超过46万家国企。\n\n拿实业央企集团举例，虽然只有98家，但这些央企的下属子公司很多。比如中石油的二级子公司就有150家，子公司、孙公司更是数不胜数。如果再延伸到遍布全国的县级、乡镇级的加油站，那就更是个天文的数字。\n\n地方国企则更多，全国每个县至少都有一个国有供电企业，同时也至少有一家国有的污水处理企业，至少有两至三家国有运输企业。各地的公交，省内客运也基本都是国企为龙头在干。\n\n毫不夸张的说，我们生活的方方面面，都有国企的身影。\n\n国企面多量广，就业岗位的总量自然就多。一个县各类国企和各类行政事业单位的用人需求比例大约是5：1。也就是进入央国企比考公考编要容易5倍。\n\n门槛比公务员低，数量又多，加大海投基数，再通过本文第四部分的渠道，你进不了国企都很难。\n\n\n# 3. 曲线救国\n\n如果你尝试了很长时间仍然发现国企正式工的offer很难拿，那不妨退而求其次、先找份事业单位、央国企的非编岗位。\n\n这些非编岗位，有些也能长久甚至做一辈子，且同样工作轻松，时间自由，有些岗位甚至同工同酬。\n\n这些半体制内很适合可以当个跳板，利用工作相对清闲与稳定的优势在职考公考编，或伺机而动找大型央国企的正式员工，实现曲线救国。找非编岗位的具体方法大家看这篇文章《非编岗位如何进去？》。\n\n本文结束，超1万字长文，希望能帮助你求职成功！',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/04/16

序\n\n面试中最难回答的问题，实际上并不是该岗位的专业技能问题，因为会就是会，不会就是不会。即使面试采购、人事、行政、关务、商务等比较“虚”的岗位，也是经验密集型工种，做过和没做过，一问就知道了，撒谎很容易穿帮。\n\n除了技术问题，我列出来了五大类“最难”回答的问题，供大家提前准备，也可以点击加了《》的文章，进去看下相关原理和答案。\n\n\n# 一，是非问题。\n\n这就是大是大非问题，在大领导面试时尽量别出错； 在小领导面试时你要表现得不是太在意； 在人事面试时你不要轻易答应而是微笑即可。\n\n这类问题之所以排在第一位，因为该问题跟我们利害攸关，属于利益权衡下的难点，稍有不慎则出卖了自己，回答错误，导致被取消进一步的面试机会。\n\n 1.  您还在职吗，还是已经离职了？\n 2.  《你的缺点是什么？举个例子》\n 3.  《你的离职原因是什么？》\n 4.  《你的期望薪资是多少？》\n 5.  最快哪一天能报到？\n 6.  《你还有什么要问我的？》\n 7.  《我们试用期工资打八折，你可以接受吧？》\n 8.  《我们需要收押员工的毕业证书，到离职才返还给你，可以吗？》\n 9.  《我们离职需要60天，你没意见吧？》\n 10. 试用期不缴纳社保，你同意吗？\n 11. 你的合同跟我们子公司签，没问题吧？\n 12. 我们是五天工作制，但每个月有一个周六值班，你不在意吧？\n 13. 《我们工资分两个公司发放，这样对你有利，你没问题吧？》\n 14. 《你读的本科为何不是4年？》\n 15. 你们公司目前经营状况怎么样？\n 16. 《原先你是管理岗，现在的职位却不管人了，为什么？》\n 17. 大领导让你选择A，顶头上司让你选B方案，客户要求C方案，你怎么办？\n 18. 你之前工作中有没有拿过外快？\n\n\n# 二，冷不丁问题。\n\n这第二类问题属于莫名其妙的提问，即你无法准备的问题，我只是象征性列了一些。\n\n所谓工欲善其事必先利其器，其实所谓无法准备也是可以准备的，多看看我的文章，平时多留意别人的经验，省得面试时被面试官突然心血来潮的提问懵住了。但是千万不要愣在那里不回答，好歹你来一句“对不起，什么，没听清。”让对方再重复下问题。\n\n 1.  《你有男朋友吗？》\n 2.  《你有女朋友吗？》\n 3.  “你家里兄弟姐妹几个？”\n 4.  《你结婚了吗？》\n 5.  《你父母做什么工作？》\n 6.  你老公/老婆在哪工作？\n 7.  《我们加个好友，是你扫我还是我扫你？》\n 8.  《你目前有没有其他家的面试？》\n 9.  《你目前还有其他家的Offer吗？》\n 10. “你的档案在什么地方？我们是要查档案的。”\n 11. 《你在目前公司待了好多年，为何没有升职？》\n 12. 你名下有没有保密协议、竞业协议？\n 13. 你为什么不考公务员？\n 14. 《你有学历提升计划吗？》\n 15. 你站起来让我看下你的身高/身材？\n 16. 我们是外企/国企，但几个月后就会被民企收购，这个你不介意吧？\n 17. 《呀！我们这个岗位不招人了，我给你推荐另一个职位，可以吧！》\n 18. 你觉得哪个行业好？\n 19. 你准备生几个孩子？\n 20. 你是网上投递简历的，还是通过朋友内推简历给我们人事的？\n 21. 你毕业没几年，为何工资开价要1万多？ ......\n\n\n# 三，预设前提问题。\n\n面试官先假设一个条件作为前提，再向你提问。这类似请君入瓮，也常常见于用小概率来倒逼你过去的荒谬，打击你的自信心，面试官从而达成控制全场的目的。\n\n这类问题也错综复杂，属于无论怎么准备也回答不好的问题，此类大家更要上心。\n\n 1.  您的经验跟我们不匹配，为何也投递简历？\n 2.  你的行业经验不足，你看最低工资你要多少？给我个准确的数字。\n 3.  你能不能提供12月的工资流水？\n 4.  你简历上为何有6个月的空白期，上份工作是不是被辞退的？\n 5.  你有没有什么项目成就？举个例子。\n 6.  你优势是什么，能否现场演示一下？\n 7.  我们周末也上班，你的身体素质如何？\n 8.  我们合同是跟第三方签的，但待遇完全一样，你能不能接受？\n 9.  你在一家公司居然待了十几年不跳槽，你是不是准备来我们公司养老？\n 10. 《为啥我感觉你对我们这个职位不是太感兴趣？》\n 11. 《我们这个岗位对你来说稍微基础了些，你也愿意来吗？》\n 12. 你目前公司很好，又轻松，我们这压力很大，你真的想清楚了要来吗？\n 13. 《目前经济不景气，你为何不再等几个月，等经济好转了再找工作？》\n 14. 《我们工资很低的，你真的愿意降薪来吗？》\n 15. 《我们试用期要1年，有可能2年，这样子你能接受吗？》\n 16. 我们偶尔要加班的，你可以接受吧？\n 17. 半年后我们公司会搬迁到郊区，你交通上没什么问题吧？\n 18. 《我们不签劳动合同而是签劳务合同，你可以接受吧？》\n 19. 《你英语水平怎么样？应该不差吧！》\n 20. 我们这个职位是外包的，你为何愿意来面试？\n 21. 这么多候选者，给我一个录用你的理由！\n 22. 我们这个岗位一天要收1000封邮件，至少处理200封，你可以吗？\n\n这种岗位肯定压力大，本身是公司问题而不是某个职位的特征。这一般不是HR问的，HR喜欢给求职者报喜不报忧，这提问明显是部门主管在吓唬求职者。最终每天邮件可能没有1000份，但三四百份还是有的。\n\n我觉得你在没有其他选择的情况下，相对可以接受，主管都开诚布公了，你回答“没问题，我能抗压！”\n\n但你也不要报太大的希望，进来前就给你打了“很劳累”的预防针，真正入职后绝不会太轻松。\n\n对于每天接收电子邮件的数量，我自己给大家一个参考如下。\n\n面试，任何情况下，都尽量表达自己是来求职的，并且准备好了入职后来奉献，来提供技能，提供服务，为公司付出。比如“我喜欢贵司，我喜欢咱互联网行业”，意思就是我早有心理准备，不怕吃苦，来了就是做贡献的，愿意付出，包括加班、出差、任劳任怨，等等。\n\n但你尽量不要来索取，即“我想转行”“我想改行到汽车行业”“我想来学到东西”......看起来跟刚刚上面俩的意思类似，但天壤之别。你“想的”尤其“学到东西”“实现改行”，那岂不是索取为主？企业给你做嫁衣裳？实现了你的愿望，还给你发工资？那企业不是和冤大头？\n\n不是太恰当的比方就是相亲中，你要透露自己有可以给对方好处的地方，比如金钱、身份、背景、学历、房产、高收入、稳定的工种、知名单位、面子，还愿意接受对方负面的情绪价值，这就是付出。\n\n但你千万别一味提出各种要求。这样对方第一次就感觉你时刻准备吸血，一直准备索取，就怕将来谈恋爱中付出过多尤其结婚后被你吸光了血。你若按照后者这个索取模式去相亲，无论你多么高富帅还是白富美，也是一次相亲就“见光死”，还没拍就两散了。\n\n你之前是在互联网公司，但我们是新能源汽车公司，行业不匹配，你为何不在原来的行业内跳槽呢？\n\n当然，这个问题一般不会问，况且你过去做数据分析和产品经理，可以继续来汽车行业做数据分析和产品经理，这就是换行不换岗。\n\n毕业年数越少越不会问这个行业问题，因为你过去的那点经验根本不重要，叫你来面试了，你就差不多是适合这个岗位的人。\n\n图片\n\n至于如上这位应届生，他担心HR问他目前面试的岗位跟过去的实习经历不匹配，那就更不可能问了。他还说真正学会了海投，那是只学会了投递数量，职位和行业的海投概念完全没搞懂，自吹了。\n\n如果实在担心，就回答：“我之前大二到大三那个暑假，也在新能源电池公司实习过，是项目助理工程师，跟我今天来面试的项目经理岗位很符合，希望你能给我入职的机会，感谢！”\n\n 25. 《现在考公务员很火，你有没有参加公考的计划？》？\n 26. 你是独生子女，打算什么时候回老家就业？\n 27. 今年应届生有1000多万，你如何跟他们错位竞争？\n 28. 《我们这两个部门都缺人，选哪个职位？》\n 29. 《你的工资已经比我们的预算还高了，你还愿意来吗？》 ......\n\n\n# 四，下套问题。\n\n这个属于故意刁难，将你引入歧途甚至激怒，让你失态。也有可能是用含糊的设问来引起一个“妈妈和老婆同时落水你救哪一个”的伦理或无解问题，主要是测试你的情绪稳定性。\n\n但有些面试官尤其HR，会趁此将公司的一些弊端当作考核你答题能力是否合格的手段。\n\n 1.  《你入职后，如何做到工作和生活的平衡？》\n 2.  《客户塞给你5000块，你收不收？》\n 3.  客户让你选A，领导让你选B，老板让你选C，你选哪一个？\n 4.  你认为去小公司好，还是大公司好？\n 5.  《你有没有职业规划？具体是什么？》\n 6.  努力工作和跟对领导，哪个更重要？\n 7.  做技术工种好，还是做销售好？\n 8.  《你觉得人一生大概跳槽多少次最好？》\n 9.  《俄乌冲突导致这批进口材料需要额外付10万元空运费，你说该我们吸收还是让供应商承担？》\n 10. 《乘坐火车出差途中，看见老弱病残你要不要让座？》\n 11. 我们公司不报销手机话费，你愿意接受出差吗？\n 12. 入职后你兼做前台，也坐在前台位置上工作，可以吧？\n 13. 《入职后一些商务活动时，你兼做领导和客户的女朋友，公司给你额外年工资增加5万，你看行不行？》\n 14. 入职后需要你驻外去客户处工作，你没问题吧？\n 15. 《入职后你帮公司做新公司的法定代表人，可以吗？》\n 16. 《我们1月份的工资3月中发放，你没意见吧？》\n 17. 你明天入职行不行？\n 18. 《先来培训2个月，通过考核后再签合同，你可以接受吧？》\n 19. 《入职后你能不能签3年不怀孕的承诺书？》\n 20. 《入职后你同时汇报给3个领导，可以吗？》\n 21. 《入职前，你可不可以先来试工几天？》 ......\n\n\n# 五，“撒谎”的问题。\n\n这类其实跟面试官无关，这些问题都是简历造假者的问题。因为造假了，他们就会觉得面试官的几乎大多数问题都看出来了他造假，形成了一个自我欺骗的思维模式。\n\n这比疑人偷斧还要严重，导致面试官的每一个问题他都去想“面试官问我上上家公司离职的原因究竟是什么意思？”“难道他发现我简历造假了？”“我该如何回答？”“他们究竟有没有第三方背景调查？”“我要问一下吗？”“难道上上家的社保也能查得出来？”“我要不要就放弃这家？”......\n\n最后，还是有备无患，大家早做准备，内心路演一番，就更容易回答面试官每一个刁钻的问题了。并且，简历尽量别造假。最近好几个人来问硕士和博士学历如何造假，我差点气得吐血。",normalizedContent:"#

四，下套问题。\n\n这个属于故意刁难，将你引入歧途甚至激怒，让你失态。也有可能是用含糊的设问来引起一个“妈妈和老婆同时落水你救哪一个”的伦理或无解问题，主要是测试你的情绪稳定性。\n\n但有些面试官尤其hr，会趁此将公司的一些弊端当作考核你答题能力是否合格的手段。\n\n 1.  《你入职后，如何做到工作和生活的平衡？》\n 2.  《客户塞给你5000块，你收不收？》\n 3.  客户让你选a，领导让你选b，老板让你选c，你选哪一个？\n 4.  你认为去小公司好，还是大公司好？\n 5.  《你有没有职业规划？具体是什么？》\n 6.  努力工作和跟对领导，哪个更重要？\n 7.  做技术工种好，还是做销售好？\n 8.  《你觉得人一生大概跳槽多少次最好？》\n 9.  《俄乌冲突导致这批进口材料需要额外付10万元空运费，你说该我们吸收还是让供应商承担？》\n 10. 《乘坐火车出差途中，看见老弱病残你要不要让座？》\n 11. 我们公司不报销手机话费，你愿意接受出差吗？\n 12. 入职后你兼做前台，也坐在前台位置上工作，可以吧？\n 13. 《入职后一些商务活动时，你兼做领导和客户的女朋友，公司给你额外年工资增加5万，你看行不行？》\n 14. 入职后需要你驻外去客户处工作，你没问题吧？\n 15. 《入职后你帮公司做新公司的法定代表人，可以吗？》\n 16. 《我们1月份的工资3月中发放，你没意见吧？》\n 17. 你明天入职行不行？\n 18. 《先来培训2个月，通过考核后再签合同，你可以接受吧？》\n 19. 《入职后你能不能签3年不怀孕的承诺书？》\n 20. 《入职后你同时汇报给3个领导，可以吗？》\n 21. 《入职前，你可不可以先来试工几天？》 ......\n\n\n# 五，“撒谎”的问题。\n\n这类其实跟面试官无关，这些问题都是简历造假者的问题。因为造假了，他们就会觉得面试官的几乎大多数问题都看出来了他造假，形成了一个自我欺骗的思维模式。\n\n这比疑人偷斧还要严重，导致面试官的每一个问题他都去想“面试官问我上上家公司离职的原因究竟是什么意思？”“难道他发现我简历造假了？”“我该如何回答？”“他们究竟有没有第三方背景调查？”“我要问一下吗？”“难道上上家的社保也能查得出来？”“我要不要就放弃这家？”......\n\n最后，还是有备无患，大家早做准备，内心路演一番，就更容易回答面试官每一个刁钻的问题了。并且，简历尽量别造假。最近好几个人来问硕士和博士学历如何造假，我差点气得吐血。",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/05/08

序\n\n求职时，尤其是面试中，有三大问题，最难回答，在这里一一罗列。\n\n 1. 请问你的缺点是什么？\n\n 2. 请问你的离职原因是什么？\n\n 3. 请问您的期望薪资是多少？\n\n所谓问题大，是因为关注的人太多，而且没人能回答得好，甚至难以回答，也没有标准答案，并且实际上就是坑。坑倒是没关系，关键这坑避不了，每次面试必问，且没有所谓的“正确答案”，每个回答都不能让人满意，这就成了矛盾的焦点。\n\n看下文之前，你想下哪几个问题是必问的坑。这里，我贴出来俩面试100问，基本涵盖了正常面试中的大多数问题，你也可以给它们排个序，看哪些最难回答，哪些就是坑。\n\n你百度搜索看看，包括各类媒体以及知乎、头条上，此类问题都是职场类目中的极高关注点。你能看到成千上万的回答，但几乎没一个回答对你有用。却是为何呢？我们来直面下“面试三大坑”。\n\n\n# 正文\n\n不错，看起来蛮客气的，“请问”又是“您”的，你要知道，这是HR给你设计的坑，这叫请君入瓮。笑着请你进坑，你可以想象下，是什么样一个情形。\n\n在这个坑中，HR会故意将一个共性问题放大，单单放到你一个人身上。HR会故意看下你的缺点，让你自己老实交代；同时，挑逗下你敏感的神经，你明明离职这才有了工作经验，才能参加这次面试，但我偏偏要挑拨下你跟上家的关系并挖掘出你“频繁跳槽”的原因，好像面试者就是“三姓家奴”；最后，简历上有期望薪资我就不看，我就是要当面问你具体数字，我看看你是否爱财，是不是一个守财奴！\n\n不信？我们将这仨问题，用长句子来再问一次。\n\n 1. 你的缺点是什么？举个例子。\n\n 2. 你的离职原因是什么？请问上家公司有什么不好的地方？\n\n 3. 你的期望薪资是多少？具体到每个月的税前工资数值。\n\n这下你发现没有？难度陡增，坑的面貌逐渐显露出来了。你记住，之所以这种问题能问出来，就是HR用来让你入坑的。后来，求职者也懂了很多套路，越来越难让他们入坑了。这咋办呢？对，洗脑。\n\n大家看下百度、搜狗，或者微信、知乎的搜索页面，我们就以“期望薪资”或者“你的缺点是什么”来入手，搜下。\n\n你想想看，你的求职，尤其是HR参与的初面，这就是个跟HR的战争，你怎么能听TA的呢？不是说HR多么不好，在其位谋其职，让你心甘情愿入坑，就是TA的工作。\n\n根本都不用看，刚刚那张图片中的张先生还是徐先生，就是HR无疑。HR们上知乎并且登录各大自媒体，专门找大学生多的地方，也吸引职场新人，是因为这些人没有职场经验，更容易中招。HR窥得职场弱势者的内心秘密，好像TA才打了胜仗一样，并且现在还到处通过洗脑秘笈让你就范，你说你多么“傻”。\n\n这就是一个洗脑的过程，让你更加迷茫，更容易入坑。\n\n你见过几个部门领导问“你的缺点是什么”的？除非这部门经理脑子有问题，这种没有正确答案的感性问题，HR问你是为了让你处于矛盾情形之中，看你笑话的同时记下你的反应能力。部门经理要是问你这个问题，倒好了，说明想进一步了解你，开始跟你唠嗑聊这种有的没的的闲话了。\n\n\n# 问题一：“你的缺点是什么”该怎么回答\n\n“你的缺点是什么？”大家注意下，这是面试100问中排在靠前位置的问题，出现的概率非常高，几乎是面试标配了。这概率高到什么程度呢？有过几次面试经历，你就知道了，几乎每两次面试会有一次被问到。你想想看，即使去一家中小企业面试，你也要有初试和复试两次基本的面试，甚至很多公司还有三面四面五面的，所以这个问题才叫做标配。\n\n这些问题，实际上没有标准答案，类似的还有“你的优点是什么？”“你的强项是什么？”“你的弱项是什么？”“你最大的成就是什么？”“你的爱好是什么？”“你是外向还是内向的性格？”......\n\n一开始，你以为这些感性化的问题，看起来很简单，实际上是非常难回答的，一个闪失，成功的面试也许就跟你失之交臂。再者，公司开始招聘并录取新人，实际上是一个很复杂的过程，有些明明有候选者了还通知你来面试，有些职位突然冻结了不了了之，所以，你的落选并不仅仅看你在面试中的表现。并且，无论中国还是外国的面试官，一般都不会当场拒绝你，而是客气地让你回去等通知。以上等因素，综合导致的结果是啥？面试结束一周后没收到任何通知，你觉得自己显然是落选了，你会去冥思苦想失败的原因，最终你想到了，“哦，问我缺点是什么的，我没答好！”\n\n大家看到了没有？以上是面试期间求职者的一个心理。尽管这个面试问题并不重要，但我们求职者会认为它非常关键。所以，对于面试官问“你的缺点是什么”这样的问题，就显得尤为要谨慎对待了。你自己想想看，此刻你就在面试，你该如何回答？在继续看下文之前，估计你心里没底，因为你会发现，无论怎么回答都是给自己埋坑！\n\n方法1\n\nPS:将优点说成缺点，行不行？\n\n这是上个世纪的套路了，现在还有哪个面试官喜欢听你这种回答的？你不是来面试而是来讲鸡汤的？还是来忽悠人的？\n\n求职者1：“我的缺点就是太专一，很专注，做事就心无旁骛……”\n\n> 你太专注了，是不是不听别人的建议，太固执，连领导的话都不听了？\n\n求职者2：“我觉得我最大的缺点就是为人特别善良，心太软……”\n\n> 你心太软，凡事都答应，最终自己完不成任务，拖了部门后腿，谁敢要你？凡事得当机立断，该拒绝的拒绝，这是工作，是商场，如战场一样，岂能心慈手软、贻误战机？！\n\n求职者3：“我的缺点是工作太拼了，我有点工作狂，为工作加班熬夜我毫无怨言……”\n\n> 你这是蛮干，我们是有效率的工作制度，你是不是想在工作中跟同事抢功，好胜心强？再说，你这么蛮干，身体吃不消病倒了怎么办？是不是会严重影响我们部门的工作进度，还有公司的项目进展？\n\n以上，将优点说成缺点的例子，无需再举了，非常容易弄巧成拙。再说，现在的职场和社会，谁还没听过套路，真信了你这种回答就被忽悠过去了，你是不是当我们面试官太傻了？太傻怎么会今天成了你的面试官的？都成了面试的“官”了，早已对你这种套路烂熟于心见怪不怪了，你还傻兮兮地班门弄斧？岂不是贻笑大方了！\n\n总结\n\n优点说成缺点，反而弄巧成拙，不可取。\n\n方法2\n\nPS:直接说自己的缺点，行不行？\n\n好的，既然优点说成缺点的套路，不能用，那么返璞归真直说自己的缺点，行不行呢？\n\n求职者A：“我的缺点是缺乏耐心，从小如此，当然，我也在改善了......”\n\n求职者B：“我最大的缺点情商不足，我不大懂得察言观色......”\n\n求职者C：“我的缺点是不喜欢勾心斗角，我是个毫无心计的人，类似一张白纸......”\n\n这三句真实的缺点说出来，你就真的成了傻缺了。无需多言，你自己动脚趾头想一想，这些话能说不？你是在面试，不是跟谁谈恋爱亲亲我我，也不是跟兄弟之间酒过三巡的一往情深啊！\n\n总结\n\n所以，直接说缺点，当然不行。\n\n\n# 破解方法\n\n下文，真正的干货要甩出来了。你稍微动下脑筋，任何问题都有破解之道，凡是人参与的事情都好办。这个问题是谁问谁的？显然，是面试官问求职者的。面试中的面试官是谁？只有两类人：你所面试公司的HR和部门主管。\n\n破题之道，就从他俩身上入手，核心要领是辨析面试官角色及职能并对症下药。\n\n# HR的弱点\n\n你来面试，第一关或者首次见面的人，自然就是HR。此时，这招聘专员已经从万千简历中将你挑出，你已经在年龄、性别、国籍、学历、经验等硬指标上，符合了招聘职位的要求了。接下来这HR面试，她要看你什么？对了，看你的软实力。通过跟你的当面交流，来核实你简历中的硬资产，同时了解你的言谈举止、反应能力、亲和力等等软实力。\n\n这一关，是很容易过去的，因为HR并不做面试者是否能被录用的主要判断者，她自己挑选的人推荐给部门经理，她当然希望你面试成功。所以，HR是倾向于你的，你成功就代表她能慧眼识人，体现了她人力资源专业人士的水平。但，现在面试你，你好歹要先过了她这小小一关，否则她都看不上你，你如何能见用人部门主管呢？\n\n所以，战略上，HR对你来说已经是“自己的人”，她不会过分为难你，问你“缺点是什么”，只是一种习惯性的面试常见提问，也是一个小小的压力测试，你只要迅速回答过去即可。\n\n等等，这迅速回答，是不是就是忽悠过去？是的话，那么如何忽悠HR呢？这就是我们第一点的核心了。\n\nHR是做人力资源管理的，她并不精通你的工作执掌，即使她看了工作描述（JD）也是不能一下子深入理解的，所以，这里的方法就是：对HR说工作执掌上面的她不懂的弱点。\n\n这句话语言不好形象描述，我们举例说明：比如你做程序员的，你说自己对于硬件搭建、调试包括机械设计方面，经验还不足；你来面试设计主管，你说自己还没做过质量部门经理对于质量体系改善还在学习中；你来面试法务专员的，你说自己财务知识还不精通，还在进一步提升之中；你过来面试一个小会计，你就说自己对于管理团队的经验还相对缺乏......\n\n以上，明白了吧？看人说话，抓住对方的弱点，顾左右而言其他，即可。\n\n# 部门主管的七寸\n\n你想想看，部门主管最关注的是什么？关于你的什么内容？当然是专业素质，其次就是忠诚度，再次就是基本职业素质。\n\n部门主管比较实在，职位也是为TA招的，招人需求也是TA提的，候选者得满足TA的用人需求，这是最重要的，也就是你的专业技能最重要。\n\n接着，所谓的忠诚度，这在面试时是面不出来的，你是关羽死心塌地，还是吕布三姓家奴？TA没有几个月甚至数年跟你的长期相处，此刻靠着面试一两个小时，无法判断。\n\n最后，所谓基本职业素质，也不是TA的事了，这是HR部门的事。这些包括基本职业操守、学历真伪、工资是否合适、履历真假，只要你之前能通过HR的面试，之后能通过HR或者第三方的背景调查。\n\n以上一分析，可见，部门主管就主要关心你的工作技能。\n\n如果这主管也问“你的缺点是什么？”“优点是什么？”“你内向还是外向？”......实际上，这是跨到了HR的职责，这部门主管“越权”了。TA为何越权问这些无关痛痒有的没的的问题呢？因为TA已经通过刚刚的面试，对于你的职业技能心中有谱了。现在问你这些问题，一是无聊且要凑足面试时间，二是个礼节性问题，三顺便花几分钟了解下你。TA是部门领导，当然知道这种问题无解，你只要别说违法或者过分激进的回答，这关就顺利过去了。\n\n对于以上的分析，我们从中可以抓住部门主管在这个事情上的“七寸”，因为TA根本就不怎么关心这个问题的答案，甚至都不该TA来问这个题目。因此，对于“你的缺点是什么”这样的问题，部门主管更好“忽悠”。七寸找到了，具体如何回答呢？\n\n答案就是回答其他跟工作不想干的弱点：你来面试测试工程师的，你说自己驾照还没到手；你过去面试质量主管的，你说自己还没学好上海话，但已经在学；你面试行政专员，就说自己对于工科思维有点欠缺，还在加强；你面试的是仓库保管员，你说自己英语证书有了但口语还在加强，只能应付工作外语，但如果跟外国人单独相处几天，一下子还有一点语言上的困难，等等。\n\n\n# 实战情况\n\n本人就是个面霸，根据以上方法，多次面试中，在HR那一关碰到这个问题时，我都是回答的专业相关的她完全不了解的弱点，实际上是不是弱点她也分不清，从没出错过。\n\n至于部门主管那里的面试，大概有一半不到的主管会最后无聊，问到这种问题。根据我的统计规律，部门主管如果是中国人，一旦问到这种HR该问的问题，我就知道事情不妙了，此时大多数可能性这主管已经有了内定人选，我只是个来陪聊的程序，做给别人包括HR看的流程。但如果回答其他跟工作不想干的弱点，还是有点用的，至少不犯错误。\n\n\n# 外国面试官，如何回答？\n\n中国的一些套路，外国人并不认为或者不懂这些套路。\n\n所以，对于外国面试官，你“将优点说成缺点”来回答，效果很好。外国人相对来说，是真正的“信人不疑疑人不用”，你说什么TA大多数情况就真信了，TA不懂国内的所谓“套路”。\n\n以上，对面试官问“你的缺点是什么”这个我们求职者都会经历的标配问题，做出了古今中外通用的针对性解答，希望对你有帮助。\n\n\n# 问题二：“你的离职原因是什么”该怎么回答\n\n这问题是不是坑？ 你寻求跳槽，或者重回职场，今天这才来面试。实际上，即使你不再找新工作了，你已经财务自由准备周游列国了，你的离职已是既成事实，所以并不是今天你来面试，才有了之前的离职。针对过往没有对错之分之经历的一种回顾，自然就是坑。离职是一个人生短期历程，面试只是求职中的一个更小的环节，这里就是另一个骗人的环节，应该称之为“以偏概全”。\n\n事实上，职场中的离职，就类似我们生活中的离婚，“跳槽”就类似“二婚”或者三婚、四婚甚至多婚。遇到新对象，告诉对方之前婚姻失败的原因，确实也是情有可原。然而，面试中，HR会对你的离职原因穷追不舍，至少这个问题是面试的标配。\n\n你试试看，无论如何回答，都难以答好，根本就没有好的回答。\n\n你这个职位明明要求有“三年以上工作经验”，我不从上家学到经验再离职后过来，你怎么能招到人呢？所以，这个离职原因问题，就是HR的明知故问。但是这一条，牵涉不到HR的人品问题，你没必要拔腿就跑，或者瞧不起对方，因为HR需要在系统中做离职原因的记录，这是一个例行公事。\n\n关于离职原因，我列出五点原则，相信只需几分钟，看完这篇回答，你以后在这个问题上就所向披靡了。\n\n\n# 原则一：外交语言\n\n跳槽的目的，对你来说应该是加薪、晋级、换行，理论上三者都占才好，实际中只要有一个能满足，就算成功跳槽。\n\n那么，对于企业招人来说，它要求“本科学历5年以上相关岗位工作经验”，请问这5年以上的工作经验哪来的？显然不是从学校里面学来的。从本质来分析的话，大多数岗位和绝大多数用人单位招人，就是挖人，从其他公司挖人过来，他们的目标就是跳槽的人。\n\n所以，企业最关注的，是看你是否有与这个职位相关的技能和综合素质；至于你之前的历史，包括跳槽的原因、上家离职的原因，都不是企业关心的主要矛盾。\n\n由此可见，我们往往过分看重了这个次要矛盾。企业早就准备好了你的跳槽，甚至用各种福利和前程来诱惑你离开上家，引诱你跳槽过来，它又怎会计较你离开是啥原因呢？只要没犯法，理论和实际中，都是没问题的。\n\n既然是次要矛盾，则我们的应对之策当然是外交语言。对于在职跳槽的人，尽量就这一句话“追求更好的事业发展”，官话为主；那么，对方如果问你“王先生，请问你离职的原因是什么呢？”你直接回答“追求更好的职业发展”即可；对方再追问：“离职总有个理由吧，请问您辞职的理由到底是什么？”还是回答刚刚那句话“为了追求更好的事业发展。”这里就不咬文嚼字了，职业发展、事业发展，都一样。\n\n正常的HR只会问一次，也有一些拎不清、心理阴暗的，会问两三次。某些HR会强调，问你这个问题是想看看你的职业倾向性、前家的矛盾跟我们家的体系是不是也不相容，这是个官话、套话，是HR想强调HR职能分工在企业中的地位。给对方一个面子，每问必答即可。\n\n实际上，HR须要在系统里维护进你的履历，其中要填写“从前雇主离职的原因”这一栏，所以才会问。这一栏大多数公司会有一个选项是“追求更好的职业发展”，没有的话他她写上去即可。所以，你不用担心对方接受不接受你的离职理由，统一用外交语言答复即可。这个记录，主要是HR用来做公司人事情况备案的。\n\n对于部门主管来说，主要是面试你的工作技能，但也有不开窍所谓花花肠子的部门主管可能会越权，他她也会问你离职原因，你照样那句“追求更好的职业发展”即可，多问就多答一次，不问不答，这几乎不会成为是否录用你的依据。\n\n外交语言中，还有一种，这里也介绍下，就是“家庭原因离职”或者“个人原因离职”，这个理由对于外资企业雇主，比较好理解，这句个人原因出来后，外资企业一般不会追问“是啥个人原因？”欧美比较尊重个人隐私，所以，这招在外企很有用，在内资企业则用处不大。内资企业的人大多数会继续追问你的个人原因，甚至追问到你“吵架”“离婚”“丧偶”“父母去世”“小孩无人照顾你又请不起保姆”，这才罢休。你别骂人心理阴暗，只能说是中国特色，现实如此，将来你面试人你也会这么来。所以，这招在内资企业，要慎用。\n\n第三种方法，如果是猎头挖你，或者朋友引荐的职位，或者你个人能力强且很自信，则你说“贵司的这个职位，我无意间碰到，觉得非常适合我，我很感兴趣，所以这才过来面试，请给我一次机会。”意思就是，你们想法设法来挖我的，我本来工作做得好好的本不想跳槽，是你们引诱了我，要问我如果离职的话原因是啥，原因就是你们下一步录用我，否则我不会离职。\n\n\n# 原则二：不说前雇主坏话\n\n任何前雇主、前领导、前同事的坏话，都不要说，实在对方问到你“如何评价你的前雇主？”你也要说它的好，说公司好，生意好，氛围好，同事好，最起码别说他们的坏话。\n\n如果对方追问“既然这么好，你为何辞职？”应对之法当然还是那几个原因：“追求更好的职业发展”“因为个人原因”“是贵司通过猎头联系到我，这个职位更适合我......”\n\n\n# 原则三：尽量说客观原因\n\n通常，跳槽，是个上家到下家的过程，表现形式就是：上家----\x3e下家。你的新雇主以及面试的企业，自然就是有可能的下家，它有理由知道你从上家离开的原因。\n\n我们可以变通下，变成这样的形式：上家----\x3e缓冲区----\x3e下家。这样一来，下家能够问你的则是，从这个缓冲区出来的理由，而不会过多问你为何离开上家了。\n\n这怎么理解呢？可能语言难以描述，实例更好说明。你看下如下真实回答吧，足够覆盖你任何一种离职原因了，从在职跳槽的无缝连接，到裸辞职业空档1-3个月，再到失业6个月甚至好几年的原因解释。\n\n“我老家有急事，现在事情已经完成，我心也安定了，所以重新回来找工作，回归职场。”\n\n“我父母开了一个小厂，很多年了，他们年事已高，我必须回去打理。现在厂也关了，我安心回来工作了。”\n\n“我已经在一个小公司上班1个月，贵司人事通过猎头找到我，我看这个职位跟我非常吻合，所以来了兴趣，今天才会来面试，请给我这个机会。”\n\n“我这几个月回石家庄，卖掉了那里的房子，我老公一直在广州工作，此间我们也刚买了广州的房子，现在安定下来，我要重新回到我喜欢的工作中来，贵司是一个不错的雇主。”\n\n“我年迈的父亲得了重病，无人照看，我必须辞职照顾。现在他病情好转且稳定了，我也已经将她接到深圳来了。所以现在我重新找工作，看到贵司这个职位很符合我，这就来面试了。”\n\n“我前面工作了12年，就换过1次工作，中间一天都没休息。这次我辞职给自己放松一下，参加了一个徒步西藏的旅游，完成了我人生的最大心愿，现在我回来了。”\n\n“家里没人照看孩子，怀孕和哺乳这2年，我必须辞职。现在有人照顾小孩了，因此我继续出来工作。”\n\n通常，如上理由你只要说出一个，对方就不再追问了，不然他她会显得不通情达理，不近人情，反而显得他她自己有点二了。\n\n这里的规律就是，找一个客观原因作为你上家离职的缓冲区，而缓冲区显然要是一个不能长久的客观偶发事件，你从偶发事件中回来求职，就顺理成章了。\n\n\n# 原则四：不能说自己创业过\n\n这第四个原则，可能跟我们常见的思维有点出入，跟百度知乎等那些高票忽悠答案不同，之前也说了那些基本都是HR回答者给人洗脑的答案。\n\n我统计过数千个跳槽和求职案例，关于创业重回职场的基本规律就是：千万不要在简历中提及自己的创业经历，一提就死。\n\n不信你试试看，真的一提就死。你想想原因，有哪家企业欢迎创业失败的人来求职的？你开过一个小店，失败了，到我们这里来应聘任何岗位，实际上你都不能胜任了，得重新培养，你的创业经历对我们来说没用。\n\n从HR的角度来讲，创业的人是最不稳定的，有野心的，万一招你进来几个月不到你又创业去了，HR不是自打嘴巴？\n\n部门主管更担心你不能安于现状，职业素养需要重新培养，还担心你跟其他同事的相处，以及你创业者思维是否能迅速转换过来。\n\n再者，从企业的角度讲，你创业失败，这本身就是能力问题，一个市场上的失败者，我们有必要接受不？如果你创业成功，比方你是另一个“强东”或“马云”，你来我们这打工，显然也是不合适的， 你注定要走，你来很可能是跟我们开玩笑，要么就是来刺探商业情报的？所以，从企业的经营角度来看，无论你创业失败还是成功，只要有了创业经历，只要简历中有了“创业”二字，基本都不会欢迎你。\n\n从统计规律来讲，我已经接到过上百个创业者重回职场的求职咨询，有开网吧失败的，有卖了天猫店重回职场的，有创业公司股东创业失败的，那种开饭店后来要回来打工的则更多。他们求职时，一开始甚至接不到任何面试电话，自从简历中去掉创业经历后，这才有了好转。\n\n所以，言归正传，千万不要提及自己的创业经历，更别说回答离职原因时还有意说自己创业失败了，这不是不打自招嘛！\n\n补充下，这里有人不动脑筋问:“不写这段创业经历，简历不就空白了嘛！？”当然写在简历上，写在这家公司工作，只是老板股东是谁，你不知道；职位呢？当然写跟你的目标岗位接近的职位。\n\n\n# 原则五：尽量不说裁员遭遇\n\n最后这第五个原则，不经历是不知道的，被裁员的经历，在职场中不属于光彩得可以示人的一面，更不要说在面对新雇主的时候了。\n\n无论是自发、他发还是不可抗力（企业破产、撤资）导致的你突然失业了，都尽量不要提及自己被裁员的遭遇。\n\n有些人在外企，领到了公司所谓"n+1"的赔偿金，开心得不得了，以为自己多赚了几个月工资，所以不少没轮到的人甚至希望自己被裁员。殊不知你自己去查下，人事档案里给你备注的离职原因，是这样一个单词involuntary，这是什么意思呢，就是指你是非自愿离职的，被公司辞退的。\n\n到了下家准备发Offer给你时，HR了解到你上家的离职原因是裁员，你是被辞退的，对不起，Offer会被取消。没人会聘用人才市场中的“次品”，尽管你不认为你是次品，这就是现实。\n\n换到内资企业，则更加严峻，被裁员的人，哪怕是因为企业倒闭而失业的情况，新公司会将你之前的公司连同你本人，都当成市场中的失败者，也是社会中的失败者，属于被市场淘汰的类别。你说会录用失败者不？\n\n因此，请记住：尽量不要透露自己的裁员遭遇，对谁都不要说。\n\n总结以上五点关于离职原因的原则，一句话概括就是：尽量用外交语言，以客观原因来回答对方，不说上家的坏话，不透露任何创业和裁员经历。\n\n\n# 问题三：“你的缺点是什么？举个例子”该怎么回答',normalizedContent:'# 序\n\n求职时，尤其是面试中，有三大问题，最难回答，在这里一一罗列。\n\n 1. 请问你的缺点是什么？\n\n 2. 请问你的离职原因是什么？\n\n 3. 请问您的期望薪资是多少？\n\n所谓问题大，是因为关注的人太多，而且没人能回答得好，甚至难以回答，也没有标准答案，并且实际上就是坑。坑倒是没关系，关键这坑避不了，每次面试必问，且没有所谓的“正确答案”，每个回答都不能让人满意，这就成了矛盾的焦点。\n\n看下文之前，你想下哪几个问题是必问的坑。这里，我贴出来俩面试100问，基本涵盖了正常面试中的大多数问题，你也可以给它们排个序，看哪些最难回答，哪些就是坑。\n\n你百度搜索看看，包括各类媒体以及知乎、头条上，此类问题都是职场类目中的极高关注点。你能看到成千上万的回答，但几乎没一个回答对你有用。却是为何呢？我们来直面下“面试三大坑”。\n\n\n# 正文\n\n不错，看起来蛮客气的，“请问”又是“您”的，你要知道，这是hr给你设计的坑，这叫请君入瓮。笑着请你进坑，你可以想象下，是什么样一个情形。\n\n在这个坑中，hr会故意将一个共性问题放大，单单放到你一个人身上。hr会故意看下你的缺点，让你自己老实交代；同时，挑逗下你敏感的神经，你明明离职这才有了工作经验，才能参加这次面试，但我偏偏要挑拨下你跟上家的关系并挖掘出你“频繁跳槽”的原因，好像面试者就是“三姓家奴”；最后，简历上有期望薪资我就不看，我就是要当面问你具体数字，我看看你是否爱财，是不是一个守财奴！\n\n不信？我们将这仨问题，用长句子来再问一次。\n\n 1. 你的缺点是什么？举个例子。\n\n 2. 你的离职原因是什么？请问上家公司有什么不好的地方？\n\n 3. 你的期望薪资是多少？具体到每个月的税前工资数值。\n\n这下你发现没有？难度陡增，坑的面貌逐渐显露出来了。你记住，之所以这种问题能问出来，就是hr用来让你入坑的。后来，求职者也懂了很多套路，越来越难让他们入坑了。这咋办呢？对，洗脑。\n\n大家看下百度、搜狗，或者微信、知乎的搜索页面，我们就以“期望薪资”或者“你的缺点是什么”来入手，搜下。\n\n你想想看，你的求职，尤其是hr参与的初面，这就是个跟hr的战争，你怎么能听ta的呢？不是说hr多么不好，在其位谋其职，让你心甘情愿入坑，就是ta的工作。\n\n根本都不用看，刚刚那张图片中的张先生还是徐先生，就是hr无疑。hr们上知乎并且登录各大自媒体，专门找大学生多的地方，也吸引职场新人，是因为这些人没有职场经验，更容易中招。hr窥得职场弱势者的内心秘密，好像ta才打了胜仗一样，并且现在还到处通过洗脑秘笈让你就范，你说你多么“傻”。\n\n这就是一个洗脑的过程，让你更加迷茫，更容易入坑。\n\n你见过几个部门领导问“你的缺点是什么”的？除非这部门经理脑子有问题，这种没有正确答案的感性问题，hr问你是为了让你处于矛盾情形之中，看你笑话的同时记下你的反应能力。部门经理要是问你这个问题，倒好了，说明想进一步了解你，开始跟你唠嗑聊这种有的没的的闲话了。\n\n\n# 问题一：“你的缺点是什么”该怎么回答\n\n“你的缺点是什么？”大家注意下，这是面试100问中排在靠前位置的问题，出现的概率非常高，几乎是面试标配了。这概率高到什么程度呢？有过几次面试经历，你就知道了，几乎每两次面试会有一次被问到。你想想看，即使去一家中小企业面试，你也要有初试和复试两次基本的面试，甚至很多公司还有三面四面五面的，所以这个问题才叫做标配。\n\n这些问题，实际上没有标准答案，类似的还有“你的优点是什么？”“你的强项是什么？”“你的弱项是什么？”“你最大的成就是什么？”“你的爱好是什么？”“你是外向还是内向的性格？”......\n\n一开始，你以为这些感性化的问题，看起来很简单，实际上是非常难回答的，一个闪失，成功的面试也许就跟你失之交臂。再者，公司开始招聘并录取新人，实际上是一个很复杂的过程，有些明明有候选者了还通知你来面试，有些职位突然冻结了不了了之，所以，你的落选并不仅仅看你在面试中的表现。并且，无论中国还是外国的面试官，一般都不会当场拒绝你，而是客气地让你回去等通知。以上等因素，综合导致的结果是啥？面试结束一周后没收到任何通知，你觉得自己显然是落选了，你会去冥思苦想失败的原因，最终你想到了，“哦，问我缺点是什么的，我没答好！”\n\n大家看到了没有？以上是面试期间求职者的一个心理。尽管这个面试问题并不重要，但我们求职者会认为它非常关键。所以，对于面试官问“你的缺点是什么”这样的问题，就显得尤为要谨慎对待了。你自己想想看，此刻你就在面试，你该如何回答？在继续看下文之前，估计你心里没底，因为你会发现，无论怎么回答都是给自己埋坑！\n\n方法1\n\nps:将优点说成缺点，行不行？\n\n这是上个世纪的套路了，现在还有哪个面试官喜欢听你这种回答的？你不是来面试而是来讲鸡汤的？还是来忽悠人的？\n\n求职者1：“我的缺点就是太专一，很专注，做事就心无旁骛……”\n\n> 你太专注了，是不是不听别人的建议，太固执，连领导的话都不听了？\n\n求职者2：“我觉得我最大的缺点就是为人特别善良，心太软……”\n\n> 你心太软，凡事都答应，最终自己完不成任务，拖了部门后腿，谁敢要你？凡事得当机立断，该拒绝的拒绝，这是工作，是商场，如战场一样，岂能心慈手软、贻误战机？！\n\n求职者3：“我的缺点是工作太拼了，我有点工作狂，为工作加班熬夜我毫无怨言……”\n\n> 你这是蛮干，我们是有效率的工作制度，你是不是想在工作中跟同事抢功，好胜心强？再说，你这么蛮干，身体吃不消病倒了怎么办？是不是会严重影响我们部门的工作进度，还有公司的项目进展？\n\n以上，将优点说成缺点的例子，无需再举了，非常容易弄巧成拙。再说，现在的职场和社会，谁还没听过套路，真信了你这种回答就被忽悠过去了，你是不是当我们面试官太傻了？太傻怎么会今天成了你的面试官的？都成了面试的“官”了，早已对你这种套路烂熟于心见怪不怪了，你还傻兮兮地班门弄斧？岂不是贻笑大方了！\n\n总结\n\n优点说成缺点，反而弄巧成拙，不可取。\n\n方法2\n\nps:直接说自己的缺点，行不行？\n\n好的，既然优点说成缺点的套路，不能用，那么返璞归真直说自己的缺点，行不行呢？\n\n求职者a：“我的缺点是缺乏耐心，从小如此，当然，我也在改善了......”\n\n求职者b：“我最大的缺点情商不足，我不大懂得察言观色......”\n\n求职者c：“我的缺点是不喜欢勾心斗角，我是个毫无心计的人，类似一张白纸......”\n\n这三句真实的缺点说出来，你就真的成了傻缺了。无需多言，你自己动脚趾头想一想，这些话能说不？你是在面试，不是跟谁谈恋爱亲亲我我，也不是跟兄弟之间酒过三巡的一往情深啊！\n\n总结\n\n所以，直接说缺点，当然不行。\n\n\n# 破解方法\n\n下文，真正的干货要甩出来了。你稍微动下脑筋，任何问题都有破解之道，凡是人参与的事情都好办。这个问题是谁问谁的？显然，是面试官问求职者的。面试中的面试官是谁？只有两类人：你所面试公司的hr和部门主管。\n\n破题之道，就从他俩身上入手，核心要领是辨析面试官角色及职能并对症下药。\n\n#

部门主管的七寸\n\n你想想看，部门主管最关注的是什么？关于你的什么内容？当然是专业素质，其次就是忠诚度，再次就是基本职业素质。\n\n部门主管比较实在，职位也是为ta招的，招人需求也是ta提的，候选者得满足ta的用人需求，这是最重要的，也就是你的专业技能最重要。\n\n接着，所谓的忠诚度，这在面试时是面不出来的，你是关羽死心塌地，还是吕布三姓家奴？ta没有几个月甚至数年跟你的长期相处，此刻靠着面试一两个小时，无法判断。\n\n最后，所谓基本职业素质，也不是ta的事了，这是hr部门的事。这些包括基本职业操守、学历真伪、工资是否合适、履历真假，只要你之前能通过hr的面试，之后能通过hr或者第三方的背景调查。\n\n以上一分析，可见，部门主管就主要关心你的工作技能。\n\n如果这主管也问“你的缺点是什么？”“优点是什么？”“你内向还是外向？”......实际上，这是跨到了hr的职责，这部门主管“越权”了。ta为何越权问这些无关痛痒有的没的的问题呢？因为ta已经通过刚刚的面试，对于你的职业技能心中有谱了。现在问你这些问题，一是无聊且要凑足面试时间，二是个礼节性问题，三顺便花几分钟了解下你。ta是部门领导，当然知道这种问题无解，你只要别说违法或者过分激进的回答，这关就顺利过去了。\n\n对于以上的分析，我们从中可以抓住部门主管在这个事情上的“七寸”，因为ta根本就不怎么关心这个问题的答案，甚至都不该ta来问这个题目。因此，对于“你的缺点是什么”这样的问题，部门主管更好“忽悠”。七寸找到了，具体如何回答呢？\n\n答案就是回答其他跟工作不想干的弱点：你来面试测试工程师的，你说自己驾照还没到手；你过去面试质量主管的，你说自己还没学好上海话，但已经在学；你面试行政专员，就说自己对于工科思维有点欠缺，还在加强；你面试的是仓库保管员，你说自己英语证书有了但口语还在加强，只能应付工作外语，但如果跟外国人单独相处几天，一下子还有一点语言上的困难，等等。\n\n\n# 实战情况\n\n本人就是个面霸，根据以上方法，多次面试中，在hr那一关碰到这个问题时，我都是回答的专业相关的她完全不了解的弱点，实际上是不是弱点她也分不清，从没出错过。\n\n至于部门主管那里的面试，大概有一半不到的主管会最后无聊，问到这种问题。根据我的统计规律，部门主管如果是中国人，一旦问到这种hr该问的问题，我就知道事情不妙了，此时大多数可能性这主管已经有了内定人选，我只是个来陪聊的程序，做给别人包括hr看的流程。但如果回答其他跟工作不想干的弱点，还是有点用的，至少不犯错误。\n\n\n# 外国面试官，如何回答？\n\n中国的一些套路，外国人并不认为或者不懂这些套路。\n\n所以，对于外国面试官，你“将优点说成缺点”来回答，效果很好。外国人相对来说，是真正的“信人不疑疑人不用”，你说什么ta大多数情况就真信了，ta不懂国内的所谓“套路”。\n\n以上，对面试官问“你的缺点是什么”这个我们求职者都会经历的标配问题，做出了古今中外通用的针对性解答，希望对你有帮助。\n\n\n#

你寻求跳槽，或者重回职场，今天这才来面试。实际上，即使你不再找新工作了，你已经财务自由准备周游列国了，你的离职已是既成事实，所以并不是今天你来面试，才有了之前的离职。针对过往没有对错之分之经历的一种回顾，自然就是坑。离职是一个人生短期历程，面试只是求职中的一个更小的环节，这里就是另一个骗人的环节，应该称之为“以偏概全”。\n\n事实上，职场中的离职，就类似我们生活中的离婚，“跳槽”就类似“二婚”或者三婚、四婚甚至多婚。遇到新对象，告诉对方之前婚姻失败的原因，确实也是情有可原。然而，面试中，hr会对你的离职原因穷追不舍，至少这个问题是面试的标配。\n\n你试试看，无论如何回答，都难以答好，根本就没有好的回答。\n\n你这个职位明明要求有“三年以上工作经验”，我不从上家学到经验再离职后过来，你怎么能招到人呢？所以，这个离职原因问题，就是hr的明知故问。但是这一条，牵涉不到hr的人品问题，你没必要拔腿就跑，或者瞧不起对方，因为hr需要在系统中做离职原因的记录，这是一个例行公事。\n\n关于离职原因，我列出五点原则，相信只需几分钟，看完这篇回答，你以后在这个问题上就所向披靡了。\n\n\n# 原则一：外交语言\n\n跳槽的目的，对你来说应该是加薪、晋级、换行，理论上三者都占才好，实际中只要有一个能满足，就算成功跳槽。\n\n那么，对于企业招人来说，它要求“本科学历5年以上相关岗位工作经验”，请问这5年以上的工作经验哪来的？显然不是从学校里面学来的。从本质来分析的话，大多数岗位和绝大多数用人单位招人，就是挖人，从其他公司挖人过来，他们的目标就是跳槽的人。\n\n所以，企业最关注的，是看你是否有与这个职位相关的技能和综合素质；至于你之前的历史，包括跳槽的原因、上家离职的原因，都不是企业关心的主要矛盾。\n\n由此可见，我们往往过分看重了这个次要矛盾。企业早就准备好了你的跳槽，甚至用各种福利和前程来诱惑你离开上家，引诱你跳槽过来，它又怎会计较你离开是啥原因呢？只要没犯法，理论和实际中，都是没问题的。\n\n既然是次要矛盾，则我们的应对之策当然是外交语言。对于在职跳槽的人，尽量就这一句话“追求更好的事业发展”，官话为主；那么，对方如果问你“王先生，请问你离职的原因是什么呢？”你直接回答“追求更好的职业发展”即可；对方再追问：“离职总有个理由吧，请问您辞职的理由到底是什么？”还是回答刚刚那句话“为了追求更好的事业发展。”这里就不咬文嚼字了，职业发展、事业发展，都一样。\n\n正常的hr只会问一次，也有一些拎不清、心理阴暗的，会问两三次。某些hr会强调，问你这个问题是想看看你的职业倾向性、前家的矛盾跟我们家的体系是不是也不相容，这是个官话、套话，是hr想强调hr职能分工在企业中的地位。给对方一个面子，每问必答即可。\n\n实际上，hr须要在系统里维护进你的履历，其中要填写“从前雇主离职的原因”这一栏，所以才会问。这一栏大多数公司会有一个选项是“追求更好的职业发展”，没有的话他她写上去即可。所以，你不用担心对方接受不接受你的离职理由，统一用外交语言答复即可。这个记录，主要是hr用来做公司人事情况备案的。\n\n对于部门主管来说，主要是面试你的工作技能，但也有不开窍所谓花花肠子的部门主管可能会越权，他她也会问你离职原因，你照样那句“追求更好的职业发展”即可，多问就多答一次，不问不答，这几乎不会成为是否录用你的依据。\n\n外交语言中，还有一种，这里也介绍下，就是“家庭原因离职”或者“个人原因离职”，这个理由对于外资企业雇主，比较好理解，这句个人原因出来后，外资企业一般不会追问“是啥个人原因？”欧美比较尊重个人隐私，所以，这招在外企很有用，在内资企业则用处不大。内资企业的人大多数会继续追问你的个人原因，甚至追问到你“吵架”“离婚”“丧偶”“父母去世”“小孩无人照顾你又请不起保姆”，这才罢休。你别骂人心理阴暗，只能说是中国特色，现实如此，将来你面试人你也会这么来。所以，这招在内资企业，要慎用。\n\n第三种方法，如果是猎头挖你，或者朋友引荐的职位，或者你个人能力强且很自信，则你说“贵司的这个职位，我无意间碰到，觉得非常适合我，我很感兴趣，所以这才过来面试，请给我一次机会。”意思就是，你们想法设法来挖我的，我本来工作做得好好的本不想跳槽，是你们引诱了我，要问我如果离职的话原因是啥，原因就是你们下一步录用我，否则我不会离职。\n\n\n# 原则二：不说前雇主坏话\n\n任何前雇主、前领导、前同事的坏话，都不要说，实在对方问到你“如何评价你的前雇主？”你也要说它的好，说公司好，生意好，氛围好，同事好，最起码别说他们的坏话。\n\n如果对方追问“既然这么好，你为何辞职？”应对之法当然还是那几个原因：“追求更好的职业发展”“因为个人原因”“是贵司通过猎头联系到我，这个职位更适合我......”\n\n\n# 原则三：尽量说客观原因\n\n通常，跳槽，是个上家到下家的过程，表现形式就是：上家----\x3e下家。你的新雇主以及面试的企业，自然就是有可能的下家，它有理由知道你从上家离开的原因。\n\n我们可以变通下，变成这样的形式：上家----\x3e缓冲区----\x3e下家。这样一来，下家能够问你的则是，从这个缓冲区出来的理由，而不会过多问你为何离开上家了。\n\n这怎么理解呢？可能语言难以描述，实例更好说明。你看下如下真实回答吧，足够覆盖你任何一种离职原因了，从在职跳槽的无缝连接，到裸辞职业空档1-3个月，再到失业6个月甚至好几年的原因解释。\n\n“我老家有急事，现在事情已经完成，我心也安定了，所以重新回来找工作，回归职场。”\n\n“我父母开了一个小厂，很多年了，他们年事已高，我必须回去打理。现在厂也关了，我安心回来工作了。”\n\n“我已经在一个小公司上班1个月，贵司人事通过猎头找到我，我看这个职位跟我非常吻合，所以来了兴趣，今天才会来面试，请给我这个机会。”\n\n“我这几个月回石家庄，卖掉了那里的房子，我老公一直在广州工作，此间我们也刚买了广州的房子，现在安定下来，我要重新回到我喜欢的工作中来，贵司是一个不错的雇主。”\n\n“我年迈的父亲得了重病，无人照看，我必须辞职照顾。现在他病情好转且稳定了，我也已经将她接到深圳来了。所以现在我重新找工作，看到贵司这个职位很符合我，这就来面试了。”\n\n“我前面工作了12年，就换过1次工作，中间一天都没休息。这次我辞职给自己放松一下，参加了一个徒步西藏的旅游，完成了我人生的最大心愿，现在我回来了。”\n\n“家里没人照看孩子，怀孕和哺乳这2年，我必须辞职。现在有人照顾小孩了，因此我继续出来工作。”\n\n通常，如上理由你只要说出一个，对方就不再追问了，不然他她会显得不通情达理，不近人情，反而显得他她自己有点二了。\n\n这里的规律就是，找一个客观原因作为你上家离职的缓冲区，而缓冲区显然要是一个不能长久的客观偶发事件，你从偶发事件中回来求职，就顺理成章了。\n\n\n# 原则四：不能说自己创业过\n\n这第四个原则，可能跟我们常见的思维有点出入，跟百度知乎等那些高票忽悠答案不同，之前也说了那些基本都是hr回答者给人洗脑的答案。\n\n我统计过数千个跳槽和求职案例，关于创业重回职场的基本规律就是：千万不要在简历中提及自己的创业经历，一提就死。\n\n不信你试试看，真的一提就死。你想想原因，有哪家企业欢迎创业失败的人来求职的？你开过一个小店，失败了，到我们这里来应聘任何岗位，实际上你都不能胜任了，得重新培养，你的创业经历对我们来说没用。\n\n从hr的角度来讲，创业的人是最不稳定的，有野心的，万一招你进来几个月不到你又创业去了，hr不是自打嘴巴？\n\n部门主管更担心你不能安于现状，职业素养需要重新培养，还担心你跟其他同事的相处，以及你创业者思维是否能迅速转换过来。\n\n再者，从企业的角度讲，你创业失败，这本身就是能力问题，一个市场上的失败者，我们有必要接受不？如果你创业成功，比方你是另一个“强东”或“马云”，你来我们这打工，显然也是不合适的， 你注定要走，你来很可能是跟我们开玩笑，要么就是来刺探商业情报的？所以，从企业的经营角度来看，无论你创业失败还是成功，只要有了创业经历，只要简历中有了“创业”二字，基本都不会欢迎你。\n\n从统计规律来讲，我已经接到过上百个创业者重回职场的求职咨询，有开网吧失败的，有卖了天猫店重回职场的，有创业公司股东创业失败的，那种开饭店后来要回来打工的则更多。他们求职时，一开始甚至接不到任何面试电话，自从简历中去掉创业经历后，这才有了好转。\n\n所以，言归正传，千万不要提及自己的创业经历，更别说回答离职原因时还有意说自己创业失败了，这不是不打自招嘛！\n\n补充下，这里有人不动脑筋问:“不写这段创业经历，简历不就空白了嘛！？”当然写在简历上，写在这家公司工作，只是老板股东是谁，你不知道；职位呢？当然写跟你的目标岗位接近的职位。\n\n\n# 原则五：尽量不说裁员遭遇\n\n最后这第五个原则，不经历是不知道的，被裁员的经历，在职场中不属于光彩得可以示人的一面，更不要说在面对新雇主的时候了。\n\n无论是自发、他发还是不可抗力（企业破产、撤资）导致的你突然失业了，都尽量不要提及自己被裁员的遭遇。\n\n有些人在外企，领到了公司所谓"n+1"的赔偿金，开心得不得了，以为自己多赚了几个月工资，所以不少没轮到的人甚至希望自己被裁员。殊不知你自己去查下，人事档案里给你备注的离职原因，是这样一个单词involuntary，这是什么意思呢，就是指你是非自愿离职的，被公司辞退的。\n\n到了下家准备发offer给你时，hr了解到你上家的离职原因是裁员，你是被辞退的，对不起，offer会被取消。没人会聘用人才市场中的“次品”，尽管你不认为你是次品，这就是现实。\n\n换到内资企业，则更加严峻，被裁员的人，哪怕是因为企业倒闭而失业的情况，新公司会将你之前的公司连同你本人，都当成市场中的失败者，也是社会中的失败者，属于被市场淘汰的类别。你说会录用失败者不？\n\n因此，请记住：尽量不要透露自己的裁员遭遇，对谁都不要说。\n\n总结以上五点关于离职原因的原则，一句话概括就是：尽量用外交语言，以客观原因来回答对方，不说上家的坏话，不透露任何创业和裁员经历。\n\n\n#

一、面试深坑题\n\n\n# 1.请谈一下你自己的一些情况\n\n【思路】：建议大家用2分钟得自我介绍，面试官较喜欢的自我介绍(1)有亮点，每一小段都有一个亮点，而不是平铺直叙(2) 有互动：每一小段都会和面试官互动，而不是自说自话，但是切记，这种互动并不需要面试官配合，绝对不要总是直勾勾地盯着面试官的眼睛逼着人家配合你，要知道面试官最恐怖的经历就是被申请人从头盯到尾!(3) 相关性强： 每一小段都和所申请的职位有关系，而不是流水账。\n\n\n# 2.你对自己的学习成绩满意吗\n\n【思路】：有的毕业生成绩比较好，这样的问题就很好回答，但对于那些成绩不太好的毕业生，可以表明自己的态度，并给予一个合适的理由，但不能找客观原因，如“老师教得不好”，显得你是推卸责任的人，同时最好突出一个自己好的方面，以免让人觉得你一无是处。 正确回答：比较满意，我想我在学校学到的不仅是课本知识，还学到很多为人处世的经验。\n\n\n# 3.你有什么优缺点\n\n【思路】：优点在这个问题上， 面试官关注的问题有两点。第一， 申请人没有撒谎， 而是真实地阐述了自己的优点。第二， 他所阐述的优点， 恰好是这个职位所需要的素质。有很多时候， 对于一个岗位而言的优点， 会成为另一个岗位的缺点。比如说， 如果你具备很强的领导能力， 往往不适合从事秘书、 助理、 客户服务代表等以细节和服务他人为主的工作。所以， 在回答这个问题的时候， 要遵从以下步骤：\n\n 1. 找出自己的三至五个优点;\n 2. 每个优点找出N多个例子， 举例最好来自学习、 工作和生活等三个方面， 而不是仅仅来自一个方面;\n 3. 在这三到五个优点之中， 精选出一两个和所申请职位最吻合的优点。 缺点认识自己的缺点是一个巨大的优点， 当HR问到你缺点的时候， 你的机会来了， 请快展示你的自知之明吧!你想把优点故意包装成缺点?比方说把"对工作负责"这个优点伪装成"对自己和他人要求过高?" 面试官会不屑一顾地批注： 这是我五年前玩剩下的把戏， 此人土冒之极。你想完全实话实说： 应聘会计的人说自己粗心?应聘销售的人说自己容易紧张?面试官会无限惋惜地批注： 此人心眼好， 老实， 但不适合我们的工作， 推荐到"实话实说"栏目组任职去吧!对待这个问题， 惟一的对策就是真诚地暴露自己的弱点， 只要这个弱点不是你所申请职位的"致命伤"即可。\n\n\n# 4.你觉得大学生活使你收获了什么?\n\n【思路】：这是一个总体概括性的问题， 很明显， 面试官期待你给出一个总体概括性的回答。 范例：回答示范1： 我觉得大学生活使我学会了与人沟通， 可能您会觉得， 十个大学生有九个会强调自己善于与人沟通， 不过我依然觉得这是我大学里面最大的收获。您从简历上看得出来， 我大学里在学生会工作了两年半， 从干事一直到副主席， 这使我有机会锻炼与年龄、 背景完全不同的人交流， 从学生到老师， 从学校的领导到校外的公司， 每一种沟通的方式和方法都不同， 的确使我学到了很多。回答示范2： 我觉得大学是我迄今为止成长最快的时期， 有很多收获。首先是知识和技能方面的， 我修了"地理科学"和"管理学"两个专业， 虽然我不打算从事地理科学方面的工作， 但是我掌握了很多必要的工作技能， 比如搜索信息、 分析信息、 独立思考等。除了知识， 我还提升了自己的综合素质。就拿我担任班长这件事来说， 我觉得提升很快， 首先是要竞选， 竞选成功以后要策划吸引人的班级活动， 策划活动的过程中要调动同学一块参与等等， 每一个环节都很锻炼人。\n\n\n# 5.谈一谈你的一次失败经历\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜说自己没有失败的经历。\n 2. 不宜把那些明显的成功说成是失败。\n 3. 不宜说出严重影响所应聘工作的失败经历\n 4. 所谈经历的结果应是失败的。\n 5. 宜说明失败之前自己曾信心白倍、尽心尽力。\n 6. 说明仅仅是由于外在客观原因导致失败。\n 7. 失败后自己很快振作起来，以更加饱满的热情面对以后的工作。如果是外企，你就可以说失败的经历就是追女孩子失败之类如果是国企，最好编一个故事，随便编什么，比如说学校的运动会，你参加800米的比赛啊，你准备成绩跑到多少秒，之前也进行了精心准备，练习，但最后没有跑到那个成绩，所以你发愤练习，终于在第二年的运动会跑进了前三，破了开始预定的目标，，哈哈，我是瞎编一个，我的意思就是告诉你，虽然让你讲失败的经历，但你讲了之后要让人家听了，虽然失败了，但是你很有精神，另外一种意义上是一种成功，明白了吧，但要注意哦，要编的圆满一点，特别涉及倒数字，一定要准确，不要闹笑话。\n\n\n# 6.如果你在大学(学院)做过兼职工作的话，你认为哪种兼职工作对你最有意思?为什么?\n\n【思路】：当面试刚刚走出校门的毕业生时(就是那些几乎没有工作经验的应聘者)，企业希望录用那些要么学习很快，要么有领导(管理)潜力的毕业生。希望对方有决定能力、毅力(时间加努力等于成功)，或是能够看清人的能力，在介绍兼职时着重突出你的学习能力、工作能力、工作业绩等\n\n\n# 7.最能概括你自己的三个词是什么?\n\n【思路】：概括自己得三个词要结合你所应聘岗位来写，然后用一个自身例子分贝来来解释这三个词，比如：学习能力强、创新能力强、有团队精神、有责任心等\n\n\n# 8.你的实力是什么?\n\n【思路】：描述你得专业技能、两三项和该工作最相关的工作经验或项目经验。避免老生常谈或过分笼统，应提供详细的例子。描述能把这些技能运用于新职位的新方法。例如，指出你仅有他们要求的工作经验是明智的，面试官肯定很重视这些，另外你不仅指出你以前的技能、相关得工作经验，还要说明你能胜任这份工作。\n\n\n# 9.你的私人生活是否存在对你的职业造成影响的问题?\n\n【思路】：使面试官深信你能把私人的感受和职业行为分开来。例如，假如你不能积极处理好危急关头的事情，你就不可能真正帮助你的病人面对创伤问题，因为那会引发你太多个人的强烈情绪 正确回答：我总是很注意把自己的私人生活与职业生活分开。我认为在给病人治病时，重要的是保持客观。一个临床医生应该能够控制自己的感情而不带偏见地给病人看病。假如你把个人的问题或感受发泄到病人的身上，那只能对病人造成伤害。这个问题对于在医疗服务领域工作的人尤为重要。面试官想知道作为一个独立个体，你是如何完善你的人格的。假如你有不能克服的个人问题，这些问题就会影响你和你病人的关系，也有可能影响你对病人的诊断，同时影响你的治疗方案和治疗建议。\n\n\n# 10.告诉我你从最近读的书中学到什么\n\n【思路】：面试官想知道求职者是否与公司的其他人有着共同的兴趣。你利用业余时间有效、轻松地学习新的东西 吗?你生性对什么好奇? 正确回答：我喜欢读人物传记，尤其是那些生活在不同时代人的传记。最近，我读了丘吉尔的传记，这本书教会了我很多领导的价值和重重压力下获得的良好的公共关系。\n\n\n# 11.你是否有过工作经验?\n\n【思路】：最好的回答是如实回答自己的真实情况。如果学员没有工作经验的话，依照岗位要求的技术方向以及岗位职责，把重点转移到做过的类似的项目经验上去，让面试官确信你的技术能够胜任这个岗位。 有过工作经验的学员，要把以前的工作经验描述的和应聘的岗位有相同之处 正确回答：之前曾经在XX网络科技公司做过网络管理员这个职位，在工作中我充分利用所学知识，对公司的网络环境进行了净化，同时对公司的网络进行了安全加固……，在工作当我学到了很多的东西，甚至包括之前我所没有接触过的方面\n\n\n# 12.“谈谈你的家庭情况”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 况对于了解应聘者的性格、观念、心态等有一定的作用，这是招聘单位问该问题的主要原因。\n 2. 简单地罗列家庭人口。\n 3. 宜强调温馨和睦的家庭氛围。\n 4. 宜强调父母对自己教育的重视。\n 5. 宜强调各位家庭成员的良好状况。\n 6. 宜强调家庭成员对自己工作的支持。\n 7. 宜强调自己对家庭的责任感。 正确回答：我父亲是位铁路工作者，母亲是做会计工作的。我从他们身上学到了严谨还有细心，......\n\n\n# 13.你的朋友如何评价你\n\n【思路】：这个问题是招聘方考察你的个人表达能力和认识能力的问题。你可以突出自己的一些优点，但是不要说得过于直白，同时要强调自己的能力比较适合做这份工作，这里技巧很重要。同时说话要机智，也可以适当加些小幽默，显示你天生有与人交际的能力和创新能力，这对于工作来说是很重要的。\n\n\n# 14.你最崇拜的人是谁\n\n【思路】：对于这个问题，最好是说一个本行业的知名人士，你能从这个知名人士身上能学到什么东西，\n\n\n# 15.你的专业课程中，哪些课程最让你感兴趣了?\n\n【思路】你在学校最喜欢的科目一般而言也是你最学有所长、学有所得的科目。如果你觉得这个科目能对你当前应聘的工作产生积极作用，就抓住机会予以强调，作深入细致阐述，否则不妨淡化处理。在回答在校期间最不喜欢的科目时注意把握如下原则：第一，要懂得如何避重就轻;第二，假如你不喜欢的科目恰好与所应聘的工作密切相关，那你就需要巧妙改变主题;第三，要有幽默感。关于这类问题，面试应届大学毕业生和毕业研究生时主考官常会提起，因此，如果你是一个青年学生，在面试前就不妨琢磨琢磨，用心准备一番。\n\n\n# 16.我想知道，你在大学时遇到的最有挑战性的事情是什么?为什么你认为那件事对你最具有挑战性?\n\n【思路】：面试者往往通过这个问题考查你的信心，信心是应聘者在面试者面前是否具有吸引力的一个非常重要的因素。有信心的人往往在办事、说话和判断中，以及在对自己的能力方面表现出强烈的信心。有信心的人善于对他们自己的决定和行为的后果承担责任。此外，他们往往把冲突视为是发展的机会\n\n\n# 17.介绍一下你的课外活动。你为什么愿意从事那些课外活动?通过那些课外活动，你都学了些什么?\n\n【思路】：这个问题考查是你的业余倾向，还有你的学习能力，切记不要说一些娱乐的业余课外活动，选一些积极向上的比如：学习小组、志愿者等等，其次叙述你在其中体现了哪些人身价值，从中锻炼了哪方面，积累了哪些经验，学到了什么!\n\n\n# 18.大学时，你为什么选择XX专业?\n\n【思路】：如果你应聘得岗位和你所学得专业对口的话很容易回答，但如果和所学专业不对口得话，回答起来就要慎重看了。比如说是父母选的或是其他同学都添的这个专业等，但上学后觉得不适合自己，在休完本专业的情况下，努力学习适合自己的动画行业，毕业之后又到专门的培训机构学习，并有项目经验等\n\n\n# 二、企业忠诚度考察\n\n\n# 19.之前的薪水有多少?\n\n# 情况一：工资中绩效部分较高时\n\n正确回答：在以前的单位，差不多一个月薪水是在9000到11000之间吧 ，因为奖金是看绩效考核的，不过我一般情况的薪水都在一万以上。\n\n> 年终奖那些看情况加上去，不用说的太具体，大概的数即可。\n\n# 情况二：工资浮动较小\n\n正确回答：在以前的单位，差不多一个月薪水是在11000左右，年底17薪+年终奖。\n\n【思路】：\n\n以上两个回答都是基于税前月薪10000左右的，部分公司绩效占比很高的话可以变相用以上话术为自己的工作能力加分，当然如果自己在旧单位绩效一般，就把绩效拉低，显得自己高，不要太老实交代即可；如果工资是固定不动的，则可以在原来的基础上多报一些。整个过程云淡风轻一些，要显得自己拿这工资是理直气壮的，重大头数字略小头(就是没必要把个位数都报给面试HR)。\n\n两类情况可以概括大多数工作的工资类别，数目可以在目前工资的基础上多报10%(这是很好解释过去的数目，可用五险一金扣除较多，日常福利，节假日现金红包，购物卡等等搪塞过去)，记得要和简历上写的要相同，具体执行起来很多公司需要提供上家工资流水，所以也要根据自己的情况来解释。由于现在背景调查愈发严格，所以虚报过高的工资容易穿帮，幅度不可过大。\n\n\n# 20.希望待遇多少?\n\n正确回答：刚到公司，还是按照公司的岗位工资我就满意了，后期我想咱们单位应该是能力与待遇成正比的 ，对吗?\n\n【思路】：常被问到希望待遇时，最好能诚实回答，考虑年龄、经验及能力等客观条件来决定，对某些企业而言，这也是评论应征者的能力及经验的参考，一般要求比以前一工作薪水高出百分之十是合理范围。\n\n\n# 21.除了本公司外，还应征了哪些公司?\n\n正确回答：这是我离职以来应聘的第一家单位，之前还没有过求职\n\n【思路】： 这是相当多公司会问的问题，其用意是要概略知道应征者的求职志向，所以这并非绝对是负面答案，就算不便说出公司名称，也应回答“销售同种产品的公司”，如果应征的其他公司是不同业界，容易让人产生无法信任的感觉。\n\n\n# 22.何时可以到职?\n\n正确回答：如果被录用的话，可按公司规定时间上班 【思路】： 大多数企业会关心就职时间，最好是回答“如果被录用的话，可按公司规定时间上班，”但如果还未辞去上一个工作、上班时间又太近，似乎有些强人所难，因为交接至少要一个月的时间，应进一步说明原因，录取公司应该会通融的 正确回答：如果被录用的话，可按公司规定时间上班\n\n\n# 23.你了解我们单位吗\n\n正确回答：之前我在网络上以及朋友的口中了解过咱们单位，咱们单位在网络行业是石家庄的巨头，……… 【思路】 ：只要毕业生提前做些准备，从多种途径收集用人单位的信息，这样的问题就比较容易回答，如果答非所问或张口结舌，场面可能会很尴尬\n\n\n# 24.希望工作地点在哪里?\n\n正确回答：至于工作地点，我会按照单位的需求而定 【思路】： 这是有数个分公司及营业场所的企业会问到的问题，如果有希望的工作地点，可据实说出来，如：现在虽然希望在某营业场所工作，但也可有“将来还是希望能到总公司服务”之类的要求。\n\n\n# 25.你为什么应聘我们单位\n\n正确回答：有两点，一是我对这个行业很感兴趣，二是咱们单位在这个行业里属于领军式企业，对我吸引力很打。 【思路】：毕业生可以从该单位在行业中的地位、自己的兴趣、能力和日后的发展前景等角度回答此问题\n\n\n# 26.你找工作最重要的考虑因素是什么\n\n正确回答：我觉得应该是发展和提升，再者就是公司的培训，每个人都有自己的职业规划和定位，二我的规划就是在这段时间内无论是外职业生涯还是内职业生涯，我希望都有所发展。 【思路】：可以结合你正在应聘的工作，侧重谈你的兴趣、你对于取得事业上的成就的渴望、施展你的才能的可能性、未来的发展前景等方面来谈\n\n\n# 27.你认为你适合什么样的工作\n\n正确回答：我大学的专业是计算机应用，主要学习的是网络方面的知识，在我毕业以后我又进行了网络工程师系统的培训，所以我觉得在网络方面的工作我会做的很好 【思路】：结合你的长处或者专业背景回答，也许单位是结合未来的工作安排来提问，也许只是一般性地了解你对自己的评价，不要说不知道，也不要说什么都行\n\n\n# 28 “你为什么选择我们公司?”\n\n正确回答：在几家应聘单位中我之所以选择咱们公司，是因为看重咱们公司在业内的影响力以及咱们公司的实力 【思路】：\n\n 1. 面试官试图从中了解你求职的动机、愿望以及对此项工作的态度。\n 2. 建议从行业、企业和岗位这三个角度来回答。\n 3. 参考答案——“我十分看好贵公司所在的行业，我认为贵公司十分重视人才，而且这项工作很适合我，相信自己一定能做好。”\n\n\n# 29.您在前一家公司的离职原因是什么?\n\n正确回答：我离职是因为这家公司倒闭。我在公司工作了三年多，有较深的感情。从去年始，由于市场形势突变，公司的局面急转直下。到眼下这一步我觉得很遗憾，但还要面对显示，重新寻找能发挥我能力的舞台。 【思路】：\n\n 1. 最重要的是：应聘者要使找招聘单位相信，应聘者在过往的单位的“离职原因”在此家招聘单位里不存在。\n 2. 避免把“离职原因”说得太详细、太具体。\n 3. 不能掺杂主观的负面感受，如“太幸苦”、“人际关系复杂”、“管理太混乱”、“公司不重视人才”、“公司排斥我们某某的员工”等。\n 4. 但也不能躲闪、回避，如“想换换环境”、“个人原因”等。\n 5. 不能涉及自己负面的人格特征，如不诚实、懒惰、缺乏责任感、不随和等。\n 6. 尽量使解释的理由为应聘者个人形象添彩。\n 7. 同一个面试问题并非只有一个答案，而同一个答案并不是在任何面试场合都有效，关键在于应聘者掌握了规律后，对面试的具体情况进行把握，有意识地揣摩面试官提出问题的心理背景，然后投其所好。\n\n\n# 30.如果我录用你，你认为你在这份工作上会待多久呢?正确回答：\n\nA.这问题可能要等我工作一段时间后，才能比较具体地回答。 B.一份工作至少要做3年、5年，才能学习到精华的部分。 C.这个问题蛮难回答的，可能要看当时的情形。 D.至少2年，2年后我计划再出国深造。 【思路】：选择B最多，A次之。B的回答能充分显示出你的稳定性，不过，这必须配合你的履历表上，之前的工作是否也有一致性。A的回答则是非常实际，有些人事主管因为欣赏应征者的坦诚，能够接受这样的回答。\n\n\n# 31.如果你离开现职，你认为你的老板会有什么反应?正确回答\n\nA.很震惊，因为老板对我算是很信赖，我就如同他的左右手一样。 B.还好吧，他大概心里也有数，反正公司现在也不忙。 C.他大概习惯了，反正他手下的人来来去去已是司空见惯。 D.我想他一定会生气地破口大骂，他是一个相当情绪化的人。 【思路】：最理想的回答是A。面谈者想借此了解你和前(现)任主管的相处情形，以及你在主管心目中的地位如何?\n\n\n# 32.你为什么还没找到合适的职位呢?正确回答：我是最近刚刚离职\n\n【思路】：别怕告诉他们你可能会有的聘请，千万不要说“我上一次面试弄得一塌糊涂……”。指出这是你第一次面试。\n\n\n# 33.除了工资，还有什么福利最吸引你?\n\n正确回答：对于我来说就是咱们公司的培训。\n\n【思路】：尽可能诚实，如果你做足了功课，你就知道他们会提供什么，回答尽可能和他们提供的相配。如果你觉得自己该得到更多，也可以多要一点\n\n\n# 34.你会为公司服务多久?\n\n正确回答：只要公司与我双方都觉得我在公司运营中发挥作用，在不断成长成熟，在公司实现预期目标中作出贡献，我乐意为公司效力。 【思路】： 把公司的发展与你个人发展结合到一起来说这个问题\n\n\n# 35.你愿意到另外一个城市定居吗?\n\n正确回答：我宁愿留在这里，不过可能的话我会考虑一下。\n\n【思路】： 尽管在某些初次面试中，你也许会被问到许多像这种能代表你利益的问题。尽管这样的问题对一个初次面试的人来说不公平，回答不好的话，你也许什么都得不到，甚至还会失去所有的东西。假如你在初次面试时被突然地问到这样的问题，只需说些如“当然有可能”或者“我愿意考虑一下”之类的话。　后来，如果你得到了这份工作，你会知道具体的工作条件，然后决定你是否愿意接受这个职位。记住，在提供工作阶段，你有大部分的谈判权利，而且雇主也许会很愿意为你提供你所需要的东西。如果那些不成问题，你也许会想说明一下，经过重新考虑，你已决定了不迁往别处，但是你想让雇主知道可以考虑把你安排在其他的在将来开放的职位上。\n\n\n# 36.你为什么对我们的工作职位感兴趣?\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 面试官试图从中了解你求职的动机、愿望以及对此项工作的态度。\n 2. 建议从行业、企业和岗位这三个角度来回答。\n 3. 参考答案——“我十分看好贵公司所在的行业，我认为贵公司十分重视人才，而且这项工作很适合我，相信自己一定能做好。”\n\n\n# 37.“对 这项工作，你有哪些可预见的困难?”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜直接说出具体的困难，否则可能令对方怀疑应聘者不行。\n 2. 可以尝试迂回战术，说出应聘者对困难所持有的态度——“工作中出现一些困难是正常的，也是难免的，但是只要有坚忍不拔的毅力、良好的合作精神以及事前周密而充分的准备，任何困难都是可以克服的。”\n\n\n# 38.你能否胜任?\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 应聘者最好站在招聘单位的角度来回答。\n 2. 招聘单位一般会录用这样的应聘者：基本符合条件、对这份工作感兴趣、有足够的信心。\n 3. 如“我符合贵公司的招聘条件，凭我目前掌握的技能、高度的责任感和良好的饿适应能力及学习能力 ，完全能胜任这份工作。我十分希望能为贵 公司服务，如果贵公司给我这个机会，我一定能成为贵公司的栋梁!\n\n\n# 39.如果MSRA公司和另一家公司同时给你Offer，你怎么办?\n\n【思路】:面试官试图从中了解你求职的动机、愿望以及对此项工作的态度。一般大家都会以公司名气和工资高低作为取舍依据，你如果这样回答：“我会把企业文化、公司发展前景、个人在公司的发展、工作部门、职位、将来的顶头上司和团队成员是什么样的人等因素进行综合分析比较做出结论，决定我的舍取。” 面试官将对你刮目相看。\n\n\n# 40.未来工作中，你想避免些什么?为什么?\n\n【思路】：一：避免出错，尤其是刚开始，慢点没关系，因为开始不熟悉没人怪你，可是你为了追求速度而错误百出就坏了，给人留下老出错的印象后，一有问题大家都会想到你，很痛苦。 二：避免受欺负，新人都会觉得刚来要和同事处理好关系，受欺负也会忍气吞声，错!既然明知道这个人是欺负你，你就要反击，决不示弱!不是你的错硬要怪你的人得罪就得罪，别人心理有数你这样的反击到底对否，不会对你有坏印象，反而会懂得尊重你。 三：不会说话就少说，打招呼不知道说些什么没关系，但是看见了一定要热情，有礼貌，哪怕只是微笑一下。\n\n\n# 41.讲述一些对你的发展贡献最大的事件或事情。请说说你从那些些事件或事故中学到了什么，并且是怎样把所学的知识应用到后来的实际工作中的?\n\n【思路】：这里你所要讲的事情是你遇到的比较积极的事情，比如你看了一位专业成功人士的个人传记，从他的身上懂得了怎么刻苦学习、为人处事、和其他同事的关系以及对工作的狂热，从而运用到自身，把他的经验运用到自己的工作当中，少走了很多弯路，提高了工作效率。\n\n\n# 42.从你的前任工作中，你所学到的最有意义的两到三件事是什么?\n\n【思路】：你这里要说的就是工作心得或是工作经验，比如使你工作效率提高的例子\n\n\n# 43.你是学生物的，为什么不去做生物和医药?\n\n【思路】：这个问题提的很尖锐，迫使你不得不暴露自己在专业上的弱点，你可以这样回答：“我虽然学的是生物专业，但我更喜欢计算机，在校期间，我经常自学这方面的知识，而且两年前，就拿到高级程序员证书。这次又通过职业测评，咨询诊断结果我作销售比较合适，而且我性格开朗，亲和力强，所以，我认为我完全胜任贵公司计算机市场开发工作。”这样，既没有说到对生物不感兴趣，没有学好专业等缺欠，又把咨询师给的合理建议端出，使面试官引起重视。\n\n\n# 三、性格等方面的考察\n\n\n# 44.你有什么业余爱好?\n\n正确回答：说起业余爱好，我还真不是很多 ，除了读书，我就比较喜爱打球，在大学的时候我是我们系篮球队的 ，我打的位置是中锋，不过最近几年因为工作的关系渐渐的打的少了 【思路】：\n\n 1. 业余爱好能在一定程度上反映应聘者的性格、观念、心态，这是招聘单位问该问题的主要原因。 2. 最好不要说自己没有业余爱好。 3. 不要说自己有那些庸俗的、令人感觉不好的爱好。 4. 最好不要说自己仅限于读书、听音乐、上网，否则可能令面试官怀疑应聘者性格孤僻。 5. 最好能有一些户外的业余爱好来“点缀”你的形象。\n\n\n# 45.你最崇拜谁?\n\n正确回答：我最崇拜马云。马云有着超乎常人的市场敏感度，以及对事物把握的精确度也相当的有造诣 【思路】：\n\n 1. 最崇拜的人能在一定程度上反映应聘者的性格、观念、心态，这是面试官问该问题的主要原因。\n 2. 不宜说自己谁都不崇拜。\n 3. 不宜说崇拜自己。\n 4. 不宜说崇拜一个虚幻的、或是不知名的人。\n 5. 不宜说崇拜一个明显具有负面形象的人。\n 6. 所崇拜的人人最好与自己所应聘的工作能“搭”上关系。\n 7. 最好说出自己所崇拜的人的哪些品质、哪些思想感染着自己、鼓舞着自己。\n\n\n# 46.你的座右铭是什么?\n\n正确回答：只为成功找方法，不为失败找借口 【思路】：\n\n 1. 座右铭能在一定程度上反映应聘者的性格、观念、心态，这是面试官问这个问题的主要原因。\n 2. 不宜说那些医引起不好联想的座右铭。\n 3. 不宜说那些太抽象的座右铭。\n 4. 不宜说太长的座右铭。\n 5. 座右铭最好能反映出自己某种优秀品质。\n\n\n# 47.谈谈你的缺点\n\n正确回答：要说缺点，我觉得我这个人有时候很固执，做一件事情的时候，总想按照预定的方向去把他做。 【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜说自己没缺点。\n 2. 不宜把那些明显的优点说成缺点。\n 3. 不宜说出严重影响所应聘工作的缺点。\n 4. 不宜说出令人不放心、不舒服的缺点。\n 5. 可以说出一些对于所应聘工作“无关紧要”的缺点，甚至是一些表面上看是缺点，从工作的角度看却是优点的缺点。\n\n\n# 48.谈谈你的家庭\n\n正确回答：我的父亲是做教师工作，母亲是做财会工作的，从小父母对我的学习情况就特别重视。……….. 【思路】 ：了解求职者的性格、观念、心态等，这是该问题的主要作用 2简单地罗列家庭人口 3强调温馨和睦的家庭氛围 4强调父母对自己教育的重视 5强调各位家庭成员的良好状况 6强调家庭成员对自己工作的支持 7强调自己对家庭的责任感\n\n\n# 49.你会在桌上放什么书?\n\n正确回答：我放一本好的字典在桌上，我也会放一本struck and white，这是一本好的参考书，能查找高中或大学里学过但又忘掉的语法知识，或者在遇到特别困难的情形也可使用。 【思路】 ：招聘者可能有兴趣判定你对你的职业有多重视。一本好字典和好的参考书对于一个从事写作的人来说是手头必备书，你可能也会把喜爱的小说放到桌上。\n\n\n# 50.作为被面试者给我打一下分\n\n正确回答：我觉得您很专业，如果说满分是10分的话 您最少能得9分… 【思路】： 试着列出四个优点和一个非常非常非常小的缺点，(可以抱怨一下设施，没有明确责任人的缺点是不会有人介意的)。\n\n\n# 51.告诉我一些有关你自己的但在你的简历上又没有反映出来的东西\n\n正确回答：你可能不知道我21岁就开始管理自己的网站，我认为你能理解我对投资销售方面的兴趣是重要的。在过去的2年里我平均每年获得12%的盈利。 【思路】：不要只是重复简历上已有的东西，讲讲那些虽与你过去的从业经验无关但能反映你的个性和经验的独特的天赋或技能\n\n\n# 52.谈谈你的星座、血型、八字\n\n【思路】:类问题对于了解应聘者的性格、观念、心态等有一定的作用，这是招聘单位提出该问题的主要原因。回答时要说：“职业是人生最大事，要靠科学的职业生涯规划来科学定位，从而找到各阶段的发展平台。不能相信星座、血型、八字等学说，那样会贻误前途，赔上时间成本。”\n\n\n# 53.请讲一下这样一个经历：尽管其他人反对，但是你还是坚持自己的观点，并把事情继续做下去。\n\n【思路】:从自己积极方面回答,比如家人和老师都希望我报考会计专业,而我对会计就是不感兴趣,毅然选择了动漫专业.我现在毕业,专业技能很强,而且有自己成熟的作品，动漫是我的事业,将继续做下去\n\n\n# 54.你的一位领导脾气比较急，批评下属时常常不留情面，大家的工作情绪经常受到影响。作为职员，你该怎么办?\n\n【思路】:首先对领导的批评应该认真接受，不能因为领导严厉的批评而产生逆反心理，以致影响工作; 其次可以私下找机会和领导沟通，向领导反映下属因此产生的意见和情绪，婉转地说明这种情绪可能会影响工作的正常开展，至于是否接受建议、改变方法，由领导自己决定。\n\n\n# 55.在工作中你的同志不如你，你的工作很出色，而他找出了你的缺点向老板汇报。你将怎么样?\n\n【思路】:找机会与他沟通，谢谢他帮我找到了缺点，让我可以更加正确全面地认识自己。 工作中积极改正缺点，更加精益求精。同时主动帮助他提高工作水平，大家相互学习、共同提高。\n\n\n# 56.你和一个同学同入一个部门，作出的成绩相同。几年后他升迁了，你没动，如何想?\n\n【思路】:一方面认真向他学习、向同事请教，并与自己进行对照，找出自己的不足，积极加以改正; 另一方面也要经常与领导和同事沟通，学会正常的人际交往，同时适时地表现自己，争取改变别人对自己的成见。 四 工作能力考察\n\n\n# 57.你了解我们所招聘的岗位吗 正确回答：有过了解。网络管理员主要是从事公司的网络管理以及维护，包括电脑单机的维护维修，以及网络的周边设备……\n\n【思路】：毕业生针对这样的问题可以从岗位职责和对应聘者的要求两个方面谈起，很多毕业生在这样的问题面前手足无措，其实只要详细阅读单位的招聘信息就可以了\n\n\n# 58.“对这项工作，你有哪些可预见的困难?”正确回答：工作中出现一些困难是正常的，也是难免的，但是只要有坚忍不拔的毅力、良好的合作精神以及事前周密而充分的准备，任何困难都是可以克服的。”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜直接说出具体的困难，否则可能令对方怀疑应聘者不行。\n 2. 可以尝试迂回战术，说出应聘者对困难所持有的态度\n\n\n# 59.“与上级意见不一是，你将怎么办?” 正确回答：首先呢，作为一个员工我的是不会和上级产生争执的，如果真有意见不一致的时候，我想我会服从领导安排的\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 一般可以这样回答“我会给上级以必要的解释和提醒，在这种情况下，我会服从上级的意见。”\n 2. 如果面试你的是总经理，而你所应聘的职位另有一位经理，且这位经理当时不在场，可以这样回答：“对于非原则性问题，我会服从上级的意见，对于涉及公司利益的重大问题，我希望能向更高层领导反映。”\n\n\n# 60.“我们为什么要录用你?” 正确回答：我符合贵公司的招聘条件，凭我目前掌握的技能、高度的责任感和良好的饿适应能力及学习能力 ，完全能胜任这份工作。我十分希望能为贵公司服务，如果贵公司给我这个机会，我一定能成为贵公司的栋梁!”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 应聘者最好站在招聘单位的角度来回答。\n 2. 招聘单位一般会录用这样的应聘者：基本符合条件、对这份共组感兴趣、有足够的信心\n\n\n# 61.你能为我们做什么?\n\n正确回答：首先我应聘的是网络管理员，如果贵公司能够录用我的话，首先，我会对公司整个网络环境进行净化，对公司的网络安全状况进行加固…………\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 基本原则上“投其所好”。\n 2. 回答这个问题前应聘者最好能“先发制人”，了解招聘单位期待这个职位所能发挥的作用。\n 3. 应聘者可以根据自己的了解，结合自己在专业领域的优势来回答这个问题。\n\n\n# 62.你希望与什么样的上级共事?\n\n正确回答：做为刚步入社会新人，我应该多要求自己尽快熟悉环境、适应环境，而不应该对环境提出什么要求，只要能发挥我的专长就可以了。\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 通过应聘者对上级的“希望”可以判断出应聘者对自我要求的意识，这既上一个陷阱，又上一次机会。\n 2. 最好回避对上级具体的希望，多谈对自己的要求。\n\n\n# 63.你是应届毕业生，缺乏经验，如何能胜任这项工作?\n\n正确回答：作为应届毕业生，在工作经验方面的确会有所欠缺，因此在读书期间我一直利用各种机会在这个行业里做兼职。我也发现，实际工作远比书本知识丰富、复杂。但我有较强的责任心、适应能力和学习能力，而且比较勤奋，所以在兼职中均能圆满完成各项工作，从中获取的经验也令我受益非浅。请贵公司放心，学校所学及兼职的工作经验使我一定能胜任这个职位。\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 如果招聘单位对应届毕业生的应聘者提出这个问题，说明招聘单位并不真正在乎“经验”，关键看应聘者怎样回答。\n 2. 对这个问题的回答最好要体现出应聘者的诚恳、机智、果敢及敬业。\n\n\n# 64.你为什么觉得自己能够在这个职位上取得成就?\n\n正确回答： 从我的经历来看，这是我的职业生涯中最适合我的一份工作。几年来，我一直在研究这个领域并且关注贵公司，一直希望能有这样的面试机会。我拥有必备的技能(简单讲述一个故事来加以说明)，我非常适合这一职位，也确实能做好这份工作。\n\n【思路】：这是一个相当宽泛的问题，它给求职者提供了一个机会，可以让求职者表明自己的热情和挑战欲。对这个问题的回答将为面试人在判断求职者是否对这个职位有足够的动力和自信心方面提供关键信息。\n\n\n# 65.你如何规划你个人的职业生涯\n\n正确回答：我对自己进行了一个长期的规划，以及4个短期的规划，现在这个阶段我主要是对自己的内职业生涯进行提升。 【思路】：分长期和短期来进行回答。毕业生在求职前一定要对这样的问题有所考虑，并不仅仅是因为面试时可能被问到，对这个问题的思考有助于为个人树立目标。\n\n\n# 66.你希望5年后达到什么成就?\n\nA.做一天和尚敲一天钟，尽人事听天命、顺其自然。\n\nB.依我的机灵及才干，晋升到部门经理是我的中期目标。\n\nC.自己独当一面开公司。\n\nD.“全力以赴”是我的座右铭，希望能随着经验的增加，被赋予更多的职责及挑战。\n\n解答：最理想的回答是D。\n\n\n# 67.为什么你认为你对该行业会保持长久的兴趣?\n\n正确回答：撇开晋升的机会不说，该行业的技术变化得如此快，所以这里有广阔的就业机会。我尤其对多方面应用多媒体作为培训手段感兴趣。 【思路】：你对该行业的发展前景有什么期望或设想?它使你不需晋升就可以获得发展吗?这家企业里什么使你最受鼓舞?你可以提供什么证据来证明你的兴趣来源于你极度的好奇——可能回到几年前的时间去找这个证据——而不是目前这些你可能放弃的一时兴致?\n\n\n# 68.5年之内你想处于什么位置?\n\n正确回答：我希望有机会在工厂或国内办事处工作。我也希望通过管理一个小团体发展我的管理技能。\n\n【思路】：不要给出具体的时限或工作头衔。谈你喜欢的东西，你天生的技能，实际的问题和在你所选的领域或行业里你希望有什么机会，你希望从那些经验中学点什么。不要谈论你在那些与你所应聘的工作无关的领域或行业里的目标。这是听起来很明显的道理，但是很多求职者会犯这个错误。不经意间你就表现出了对当前的领域或行业缺乏真正的兴趣。不用说，一失言马上就会把你从进一步的考虑中淘汰掉。\n\n\n# 69.描述你的理想职业\n\n正确回答：不管发生什么事情，我都愿意在与IT有关的领域里工作。和在大学中教学的工作相比，我还是对IT感兴趣。但我相信从事IT是我的天性，我擅长销售是因为我愿意花时间去教我的客户。现在我热切盼望我能培训那些新招聘进来的人。 【思路】：谈及你喜欢的东西，你天生的技能，实际的问题或在这份特定工作或行业里你所期盼的机会，你希望从那些经验里学点什么东西。避免谈具体的时限和工作头衔。\n\n\n# 70.如果你有无限的时间和经济来源，你会怎样使用它们呢?\n\n正确回答：我希望能参加几次不针对金融专家的有关金融管理的行政研讨会。我还希望能让我的部门放长假，把每一个人都派去参加外界的一些活动。最后，我很可能去旅游并考察一下外国竞争者，同时一路享受当地的美食，您呢? 【思路】：虽然娱乐的事情谈起来很有诱惑力，但一定要紧扣工作或与行业相关的事务，或者紧扣与你应聘的这份工作的技能相关的努力上。例如，你正在应聘教书工作，你可能对义务教授成年人读书识字的项目感兴趣。这就证明了你对自己的工作领域的激情，即对教育重要性的一种信仰，即使是作为一种兴趣而毫无报酬都无所谓 71.告诉我你了解这家公司的什么正确回答：在这之前，我曾听朋友谈及过咱们公司，对咱们公司的大概情况进行了一个简单的了解。 【思路】：描述你第一次或是近来邂逅该公司或其产品及其服务的情况。是什么促使你想在那里工作而不是在另一家不同的公司里做同样类型的工作呢?招聘者会仔细观察反映你真正兴趣的方面，而不仅是你对该公司所做的一些表面上的调查了解。把公司的年度报告背出来不大可能会给招聘者留下印象，但把来自顾客和员工的一些反馈意见说出来可能会给招聘者留下印象。\n\n\n# 72.你是怎么知道我们招聘这个职位的呢?\n\n正确回答：一个朋友告诉我的，他是咱们公司XX部门的，我们是大学同学。 【思路】：如果你是从公司内部某人处打听回来的消息，记得提及他的名字，公司不说偏袒内部关系不代表它不存在。\n\n\n# 73.这份工作哪些方面吸引你?哪些方面令你感到还不满意?\n\n正确回答：首先，贵公司在业内是属于领军式的企业，我觉得这样一个企业是值得我去为之而奋斗的……….. 【思路】：列举3个以上这份工作吸引你的因素;但，对于后一个问题给一个微不足道的小缺陷，轻描淡写，点到即止。\n\n\n# 74.假如现在是你在我们公司做首次年度总结，我该告诉你一些什么呢?\n\n正确回答：您要感谢我把工作完成得很好，并说明您渴望能够继续看到我工作的好成绩。更重要的是，我希望您能告诉我，您很欣赏我为一些重要项目加班加点工作的行为，还有我富有创造性的思维是如何有助于对存在的问题提出改革方案的。 【思路】：很明显，在回答该问题时，你想给人留下积极的印象。“但愿您能更准时地出现”绝对不是一个好答案。记住，重点谈一两点你个人的优势。\n\n\n# 75.为什么你想在这里工作?\n\n正确回答：我几年前就错过了你们公司的一次招标，之后我意识到电脑产品变得越来越相近了，且零售价格的竞争愈趋激烈，以致服务成为了一家公司在竞争中脱颖而出的最好的方法。贵公司在所有的竞争者中享有最好的服务记录，而我相信从长远看，它将主宰这个行业。你的准备和调查研究工作应在这里明显表现出来。 【思路】：给出一到两个你对该公司感兴趣的原因，并表明什么最激发你的兴趣。什么是你可以叙述来表明你个人对该公司的认识的最有说服力的事情呢?它的产品还是它的员工?答案包括公司的信誉、对该工作本身的描述，或者是跻身于该企业的欲望。\n\n\n# 76.你从我们公司的顾客、员工，或者别人那儿了解了我们公司的一些什么情况?\n\n正确回答：我确实给你们小册子上提到的几个客户打过电话。我与之交谈的顾客中有两人解释了他们为什么年复一年地购买你们的产品。你们的供销运作是很棒的，但还有没有一些可提高的服务项目呢? 【思路】：-叙述通过你个人与公司代表们的接触后，你的兴趣又是如何增长的。为面试进行而富有创造性地思考。例如，在你面试之前，和一些零售商或公司生产线上别的供销点的工人交谈。他们能告诉你一些什么?给出一到两个你所了解到的例子来解释你为什么对这家公司感兴趣。什么是你可以用来证明你兴趣的最有力的例子?\n\n\n# 77.我们为什么要聘请你呢?\n\n正确回答：　“我在这个领域的经验很少人比得上，而且我的适应能力使我确信我能把职责带上一个新的台阶”。 【思路】：这个问题听起来既消极又可疑，或者十分刻薄。但实际上，面试官是想让你帮助他聘用你。你拥有他们需要的才识，经验，能力和技能，他们要找的正是你。\n\n\n# 78.你对加班的看法。\n\n正确回答：首先我想确认下，是何种性质的加班? 如果是我个人的工作量是在规定的时间内没有完成的话，这种情况是不会发生的，我是个注重工作效率的人。其次如果是公司业务量临时增加的话，我会接受加班。 【思路】：首先，明确的告诉对方，如果是因为自己在规定的时间内没有完成工作任务的话 ，需要加班的情况是几乎不可能出现的，“我是个注重工作效率的人”其次，如果是因为公司业务情况或者其他的一些紧急工作的话是可以适应加班的。\n\n\n# 79.经常需要出差的工作适合你的生活方式吗?\n\n正确回答：对我或我的家庭来说，这种经常需要出差的顾问工作是完全没有问题的。\n\n\n# 80.就你的能力而言，如何让我相信你能够胜任这份工作?\n\n正确回答：就我之前的工作经验而言，我觉得我能够胜任这份工作，网络管理员主要负责公司内部局域网的……..，我在以前的单位，做的正是这些。\n\n【思路】：这个问题要从所应聘的岗位职责和要求入手，阐述你在这方面的实力\n\n\n# 81.你的应变能力如何?\n\n正确回答：举个例子：在06年年底，这是个考察求职者的创造力和主动性的问题。举一个你如何改变计划或方向并且取得同样或更好效果的例子。你要侧重谈你怎样获得至关重要的信息或者是你如何改变个人作风获得与别人合作的机会\n\n\n# 四、团队精神\n\n\n# 82.团结是做好各项工作的基础。你如果是其中一员，对搞好本项目组团结有什么想法和打算?\n\n【思路】:l.要搞好一个组的团结，组长是关键。作为一名组员，要把维护和增强项目组团结作为协助组长工作的一项重要内容。2.正确处理本项目组组长成员之间的关系，积极搞好项目组的团结，为其他工作人员搞好团结作出表率。3.正确运用批评与自我批评的武器，及时纠正错误\n\n\n# 83.你能给公司带来什么?\n\n【思路】:一般外企很想知道未来的员工能为企业做什么，求职者应再次重复自己的优势，然后说：“就我的能力，我可以做一个优秀的员工在组织中发挥能力，给组织带来高效率和更多的收益”。外企喜欢求职者就申请的职位表明自己的能力，比如申请营销之类的职位，可以说：“我可以开发大量的新客户，同时，对老客户做更全面周到的服务，开发老客户的新需求和消费。”等等。\n\n\n# 84.你认为怎样才算一个好的团队者?\n\n【思路】:大家目标一致、齐心协力、互相学习、互相帮助、为团队贡献自己每一份力量，我认为这样的团队才是一个好的团队\n\n\n# 85怎样看待朋友越多越好?\n\n【思路】:不可否认，就如社会上所言，朋友多了好走路。但我认为，交友要慎，要在本职工作的基础上交朋友。一是要多与领导和同事交朋友，多交流、多谈心，沟通思想，增进了解，互相支持，形成合力，其根本是加强团结，从而促进工作的顺利开展。同时时刻正确衡量自己，职人之长，补己之短。二是要多与工作联系单位的同志交朋友，以诚为本，以诚相待、以礼相待\n\n\n# 五、工作主动性\n\n\n# 86.你期望的工资是多少?\n\n【思路】企业的工资水平是很灵活的，何种能力拿何种工资。企业喜欢直率的人，但这个问题却不能正面回答，企业希望听到：“以我的能力和我的优势，我完全可以胜任这个职位，我相信我可以做得很好。但是贵公司对这个职位的描述不是很具体，我想还可以延后再讨论”。企业欢迎求职者给其定薪的自由度，而不是咬准一个价码。\n\n\n# 87.就你申请的这个职位，你认为你还欠缺什么?\n\n【思路】:企业喜欢问求职者弱点，但精明的求职者一般不直接回答。他们希望看到这样的求职者：继续重复自己的优势，然后说：“对于这个职位和我的能力来说，我相信自己是可以胜任的，只是缺乏经验，这个问题我想我可以进入公司以后以最短的时间来解决，我的学习能力很强，我相信可以很快融入公司的企业文化，进入工作状态。”企业喜欢能够巧妙地躲过难题的求职者。\n\n\n# 88.说说你对行业、技术发展趋势的看法?\n\n【思路】:企业对这个问题很感兴趣，只有有备而来的求职者能够过关。求职者可以直接在网上查找对你所申请的行业部门的信息，只有深入了解才能产生独特的见解。企业认为最聪明的求职者是对所面试的公司预先了解很多，包括公司各个部门，发展情况，在面试回答问题的时候可以提到所了解的情况，企业欢迎进入企业的人是“知己”，而不是“盲人”。\n\n\n# 89.你认为你在学校属于好学生吗?\n\n【思路】:企业的招聘者很精明，问这个问题可以试探出很多问题：如果求职者学习成绩好，就会说：“是的，我的成绩很好，所有的成绩都很优异。当然，判断一个学生是不是好学生有很多标准，在学校期间我认为成绩是重要的，其他方面包括思想道德、实践经验、团队精神、沟通能力也都是很重要的，我在这些方面也做得很好，应该说我是一个全面发展的学生。”如果求职者成绩不尽理想，便会说：“我认为是不是一个好学生的标准是多元化的，我的学习成绩还可以，在其他方面我的表现也很突出，比如我去很多地方实习过，我很喜欢在快节奏和压力下工作，我在学生会组织过××活动，锻炼了我的团队合作精神和组织能力。” 有经验的招聘者一听就会明白，企业喜欢诚实的求职者。\n\n\n# 90.有人说“成功是对人有益的”，也有人说“失败是对人有益的”，你怎么看?\n\n【思路】:成功是对努力的一种回报，一种肯定，能使人们认识到自身的价值，对自身是一种动力，能激发人们继续创新、学习的勇气!当然，成功是对人有益的。 “失败是对人有益的”，俗话说“失败乃成功之母”，它给予人们更多的是经验与坚韧顽强的精神和永不认输的斗志，所以说“失败是对人有益的”。 这类题的应对方法：辩证地看、联系地看，肯定一方但不否定另一方，两者是有机的统一\n\n\n# 91你在办公室工作的时侯，有各类传真电话和公开电话打进来(咨询程序，有外地单位的人员要过来参观学习。。。具体事务记不清了)，你如何处理这些电话?\n\n【思路】:根据事情的轻重缓急和是否属于自己的职责范围内来处理。(1)职责范围内且能够解决的，自己解决。(2)职责范围内但不能解决的，请示解决。(3)职责范围外不能解决的，转交解决。\n\n\n# 92.如何主持一次会议?\n\n【思路】:1)确定主题，议题，准备好相关的材料。(2)确定时间、地点、参加人及应邀请的领导嘉宾。(3)安排议程，顺序，并安排好食宿。(4)经领导同意后发邀请函。(5)安排好会场(主席台，台标等)及报到处。(6)安排好主席人，报告人，发言人，及记录人员。(7)会后整理好资料，向领导做一次情况汇报。\n\n\n# 93.如果我们单位录用了你，但工作一段时间却发现你根本不适合这个职位你怎么办?\n\n【思路】:一段时间发现工作不适合我，有两种情况：1.如果你确实热爱这个职业，那你就要不断学习，虚心向领导和同事学习业务知识和处事经验，了解这个职业的精神内涵和职业要求，力争减少差距;2.你觉得这个职业可有可无，那还是趁早换个职业，去发现适合你的，你热爱的职业，那样你的发展前途也会大点，对单位和个人都有好处。，\n\n\n# 六、适应能力\n\n\n# 94.请谈谈你个人的最大特色。\n\n【思路】:A.我人缘极佳，连续3年担任班委。 B.我的坚持度很高，事情没有做到一个令人满意的结果，绝不罢手。 C.我非常守时，工作以来，我从没有迟到过。 D.我的个性很随和，是大家公认的好好先生(小姐)。 解答：这题理想的回答是B。A、C、D虽然都表示出应征者个性上的优点，但只有B的回答，最能和工作结合，能够与工作表现相结合的优点、特质，才是面谈者比较感兴趣的回答。\n\n\n# 95.你是否愿意从基层做起?\n\n【思路】:主要考察应聘者是否是一个踏实肯干而非眼高手低的人。职场新人可以表示自己愿意从基层开始锻炼自己\n\n\n# 96.现代人际关系非常重要，你对此有何看法?\n\n【思路】:现代人际关系就是搞好工作、实现自我价值的一个重要因素。如果人际关系不好，就会感到苦恼，一旦陷入苦恼中，还会有精力做好工作吗?所以我认为，要搞好工作，决不能忽视人际关系。\n\n\n# 97.当某件事老是没有结果是，你该怎样做?\n\n【思路】:首先自己换位思考把前因、过程分析一下，另外请教专业人士。如果自己做法错误马上改正，如果方法不对改变方式\n\n\n# 98.你如何看待你所应聘的岗位?\n\n【思路】:各个岗位在责任、权利、利益、分工、合作、技能、技巧等方面，都有明显的要求，而这往往是区别于其他岗位的，每个岗位都有其对员工的特殊性，在专业化日益增强的今天，“万金油”式的人越来越不被看好。所以，你切不可说“我能干这也能干那”，而应明晰在管理的半径、层面、空间上是有着很大差别的。有人往往在此时急求事功，在未详细了解岗位的具体要求情况下仓促应允，以为自己什么都干得了，这不明智，而且容易招致面试方反感。该岗位需要的所有内容，正是面试者想从你这里听到的，你也只需照此行事即可。\n\n\n# 99.假如让你干一项工作，这个工作估计一周就能够完成。干了几天后，你发现，即使干上三周也没法完成这个任务。你该怎样处理这种情形?为什么?\n\n【思路】:发现及时向领导反映,说明其真实情况,如果领导说可以延长那你把大概完成时间向领导汇报,但领导说不能延长时间,那你就请求领导增加人手,确保在要求时间内完成。\n\n\n# 100.讲一个这样的经历：本来是你自己的工作，但别人却给你提供了很多帮助。\n\n【思路】:切记千万不要说因自己无能,别人来帮助;可以说时间紧或让提前完成,没有办法请他人帮助。',normalizedContent:'# 一、面试深坑题\n\n\n# 1.请谈一下你自己的一些情况\n\n【思路】：建议大家用2分钟得自我介绍，面试官较喜欢的自我介绍(1)有亮点，每一小段都有一个亮点，而不是平铺直叙(2) 有互动：每一小段都会和面试官互动，而不是自说自话，但是切记，这种互动并不需要面试官配合，绝对不要总是直勾勾地盯着面试官的眼睛逼着人家配合你，要知道面试官最恐怖的经历就是被申请人从头盯到尾!(3) 相关性强： 每一小段都和所申请的职位有关系，而不是流水账。\n\n\n# 2.你对自己的学习成绩满意吗\n\n【思路】：有的毕业生成绩比较好，这样的问题就很好回答，但对于那些成绩不太好的毕业生，可以表明自己的态度，并给予一个合适的理由，但不能找客观原因，如“老师教得不好”，显得你是推卸责任的人，同时最好突出一个自己好的方面，以免让人觉得你一无是处。 正确回答：比较满意，我想我在学校学到的不仅是课本知识，还学到很多为人处世的经验。\n\n\n# 3.你有什么优缺点\n\n【思路】：优点在这个问题上， 面试官关注的问题有两点。第一， 申请人没有撒谎， 而是真实地阐述了自己的优点。第二， 他所阐述的优点， 恰好是这个职位所需要的素质。有很多时候， 对于一个岗位而言的优点， 会成为另一个岗位的缺点。比如说， 如果你具备很强的领导能力， 往往不适合从事秘书、 助理、 客户服务代表等以细节和服务他人为主的工作。所以， 在回答这个问题的时候， 要遵从以下步骤：\n\n 1. 找出自己的三至五个优点;\n 2. 每个优点找出n多个例子， 举例最好来自学习、 工作和生活等三个方面， 而不是仅仅来自一个方面;\n 3. 在这三到五个优点之中， 精选出一两个和所申请职位最吻合的优点。 缺点认识自己的缺点是一个巨大的优点， 当hr问到你缺点的时候， 你的机会来了， 请快展示你的自知之明吧!你想把优点故意包装成缺点?比方说把"对工作负责"这个优点伪装成"对自己和他人要求过高?" 面试官会不屑一顾地批注： 这是我五年前玩剩下的把戏， 此人土冒之极。你想完全实话实说： 应聘会计的人说自己粗心?应聘销售的人说自己容易紧张?面试官会无限惋惜地批注： 此人心眼好， 老实， 但不适合我们的工作， 推荐到"实话实说"栏目组任职去吧!对待这个问题， 惟一的对策就是真诚地暴露自己的弱点， 只要这个弱点不是你所申请职位的"致命伤"即可。\n\n\n# 4.你觉得大学生活使你收获了什么?\n\n【思路】：这是一个总体概括性的问题， 很明显， 面试官期待你给出一个总体概括性的回答。 范例：回答示范1： 我觉得大学生活使我学会了与人沟通， 可能您会觉得， 十个大学生有九个会强调自己善于与人沟通， 不过我依然觉得这是我大学里面最大的收获。您从简历上看得出来， 我大学里在学生会工作了两年半， 从干事一直到副主席， 这使我有机会锻炼与年龄、 背景完全不同的人交流， 从学生到老师， 从学校的领导到校外的公司， 每一种沟通的方式和方法都不同， 的确使我学到了很多。回答示范2： 我觉得大学是我迄今为止成长最快的时期， 有很多收获。首先是知识和技能方面的， 我修了"地理科学"和"管理学"两个专业， 虽然我不打算从事地理科学方面的工作， 但是我掌握了很多必要的工作技能， 比如搜索信息、 分析信息、 独立思考等。除了知识， 我还提升了自己的综合素质。就拿我担任班长这件事来说， 我觉得提升很快， 首先是要竞选， 竞选成功以后要策划吸引人的班级活动， 策划活动的过程中要调动同学一块参与等等， 每一个环节都很锻炼人。\n\n\n# 5.谈一谈你的一次失败经历\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜说自己没有失败的经历。\n 2. 不宜把那些明显的成功说成是失败。\n 3. 不宜说出严重影响所应聘工作的失败经历\n 4. 所谈经历的结果应是失败的。\n 5. 宜说明失败之前自己曾信心白倍、尽心尽力。\n 6. 说明仅仅是由于外在客观原因导致失败。\n 7. 失败后自己很快振作起来，以更加饱满的热情面对以后的工作。如果是外企，你就可以说失败的经历就是追女孩子失败之类如果是国企，最好编一个故事，随便编什么，比如说学校的运动会，你参加800米的比赛啊，你准备成绩跑到多少秒，之前也进行了精心准备，练习，但最后没有跑到那个成绩，所以你发愤练习，终于在第二年的运动会跑进了前三，破了开始预定的目标，，哈哈，我是瞎编一个，我的意思就是告诉你，虽然让你讲失败的经历，但你讲了之后要让人家听了，虽然失败了，但是你很有精神，另外一种意义上是一种成功，明白了吧，但要注意哦，要编的圆满一点，特别涉及倒数字，一定要准确，不要闹笑话。\n\n\n# 6.如果你在大学(学院)做过兼职工作的话，你认为哪种兼职工作对你最有意思?为什么?\n\n【思路】：当面试刚刚走出校门的毕业生时(就是那些几乎没有工作经验的应聘者)，企业希望录用那些要么学习很快，要么有领导(管理)潜力的毕业生。希望对方有决定能力、毅力(时间加努力等于成功)，或是能够看清人的能力，在介绍兼职时着重突出你的学习能力、工作能力、工作业绩等\n\n\n# 7.最能概括你自己的三个词是什么?\n\n【思路】：概括自己得三个词要结合你所应聘岗位来写，然后用一个自身例子分贝来来解释这三个词，比如：学习能力强、创新能力强、有团队精神、有责任心等\n\n\n# 8.你的实力是什么?\n\n【思路】：描述你得专业技能、两三项和该工作最相关的工作经验或项目经验。避免老生常谈或过分笼统，应提供详细的例子。描述能把这些技能运用于新职位的新方法。例如，指出你仅有他们要求的工作经验是明智的，面试官肯定很重视这些，另外你不仅指出你以前的技能、相关得工作经验，还要说明你能胜任这份工作。\n\n\n# 9.你的私人生活是否存在对你的职业造成影响的问题?\n\n【思路】：使面试官深信你能把私人的感受和职业行为分开来。例如，假如你不能积极处理好危急关头的事情，你就不可能真正帮助你的病人面对创伤问题，因为那会引发你太多个人的强烈情绪 正确回答：我总是很注意把自己的私人生活与职业生活分开。我认为在给病人治病时，重要的是保持客观。一个临床医生应该能够控制自己的感情而不带偏见地给病人看病。假如你把个人的问题或感受发泄到病人的身上，那只能对病人造成伤害。这个问题对于在医疗服务领域工作的人尤为重要。面试官想知道作为一个独立个体，你是如何完善你的人格的。假如你有不能克服的个人问题，这些问题就会影响你和你病人的关系，也有可能影响你对病人的诊断，同时影响你的治疗方案和治疗建议。\n\n\n# 10.告诉我你从最近读的书中学到什么\n\n【思路】：面试官想知道求职者是否与公司的其他人有着共同的兴趣。你利用业余时间有效、轻松地学习新的东西 吗?你生性对什么好奇? 正确回答：我喜欢读人物传记，尤其是那些生活在不同时代人的传记。最近，我读了丘吉尔的传记，这本书教会了我很多领导的价值和重重压力下获得的良好的公共关系。\n\n\n# 11.你是否有过工作经验?\n\n【思路】：最好的回答是如实回答自己的真实情况。如果学员没有工作经验的话，依照岗位要求的技术方向以及岗位职责，把重点转移到做过的类似的项目经验上去，让面试官确信你的技术能够胜任这个岗位。 有过工作经验的学员，要把以前的工作经验描述的和应聘的岗位有相同之处 正确回答：之前曾经在xx网络科技公司做过网络管理员这个职位，在工作中我充分利用所学知识，对公司的网络环境进行了净化，同时对公司的网络进行了安全加固……，在工作当我学到了很多的东西，甚至包括之前我所没有接触过的方面\n\n\n# 12.“谈谈你的家庭情况”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 况对于了解应聘者的性格、观念、心态等有一定的作用，这是招聘单位问该问题的主要原因。\n 2. 简单地罗列家庭人口。\n 3. 宜强调温馨和睦的家庭氛围。\n 4. 宜强调父母对自己教育的重视。\n 5. 宜强调各位家庭成员的良好状况。\n 6. 宜强调家庭成员对自己工作的支持。\n 7. 宜强调自己对家庭的责任感。 正确回答：我父亲是位铁路工作者，母亲是做会计工作的。我从他们身上学到了严谨还有细心，......\n\n\n# 13.你的朋友如何评价你\n\n【思路】：这个问题是招聘方考察你的个人表达能力和认识能力的问题。你可以突出自己的一些优点，但是不要说得过于直白，同时要强调自己的能力比较适合做这份工作，这里技巧很重要。同时说话要机智，也可以适当加些小幽默，显示你天生有与人交际的能力和创新能力，这对于工作来说是很重要的。\n\n\n# 14.你最崇拜的人是谁\n\n【思路】：对于这个问题，最好是说一个本行业的知名人士，你能从这个知名人士身上能学到什么东西，\n\n\n# 15.你的专业课程中，哪些课程最让你感兴趣了?\n\n【思路】你在学校最喜欢的科目一般而言也是你最学有所长、学有所得的科目。如果你觉得这个科目能对你当前应聘的工作产生积极作用，就抓住机会予以强调，作深入细致阐述，否则不妨淡化处理。在回答在校期间最不喜欢的科目时注意把握如下原则：第一，要懂得如何避重就轻;第二，假如你不喜欢的科目恰好与所应聘的工作密切相关，那你就需要巧妙改变主题;第三，要有幽默感。关于这类问题，面试应届大学毕业生和毕业研究生时主考官常会提起，因此，如果你是一个青年学生，在面试前就不妨琢磨琢磨，用心准备一番。\n\n\n# 16.我想知道，你在大学时遇到的最有挑战性的事情是什么?为什么你认为那件事对你最具有挑战性?\n\n【思路】：面试者往往通过这个问题考查你的信心，信心是应聘者在面试者面前是否具有吸引力的一个非常重要的因素。有信心的人往往在办事、说话和判断中，以及在对自己的能力方面表现出强烈的信心。有信心的人善于对他们自己的决定和行为的后果承担责任。此外，他们往往把冲突视为是发展的机会\n\n\n# 17.介绍一下你的课外活动。你为什么愿意从事那些课外活动?通过那些课外活动，你都学了些什么?\n\n【思路】：这个问题考查是你的业余倾向，还有你的学习能力，切记不要说一些娱乐的业余课外活动，选一些积极向上的比如：学习小组、志愿者等等，其次叙述你在其中体现了哪些人身价值，从中锻炼了哪方面，积累了哪些经验，学到了什么!\n\n\n# 18.大学时，你为什么选择xx专业?\n\n【思路】：如果你应聘得岗位和你所学得专业对口的话很容易回答，但如果和所学专业不对口得话，回答起来就要慎重看了。比如说是父母选的或是其他同学都添的这个专业等，但上学后觉得不适合自己，在休完本专业的情况下，努力学习适合自己的动画行业，毕业之后又到专门的培训机构学习，并有项目经验等\n\n\n# 二、企业忠诚度考察\n\n\n# 19.之前的薪水有多少?\n\n# 情况一：工资中绩效部分较高时\n\n正确回答：在以前的单位，差不多一个月薪水是在9000到11000之间吧 ，因为奖金是看绩效考核的，不过我一般情况的薪水都在一万以上。\n\n> 年终奖那些看情况加上去，不用说的太具体，大概的数即可。\n\n# 情况二：工资浮动较小\n\n正确回答：在以前的单位，差不多一个月薪水是在11000左右，年底17薪+年终奖。\n\n【思路】：\n\n以上两个回答都是基于税前月薪10000左右的，部分公司绩效占比很高的话可以变相用以上话术为自己的工作能力加分，当然如果自己在旧单位绩效一般，就把绩效拉低，显得自己高，不要太老实交代即可；如果工资是固定不动的，则可以在原来的基础上多报一些。整个过程云淡风轻一些，要显得自己拿这工资是理直气壮的，重大头数字略小头(就是没必要把个位数都报给面试hr)。\n\n两类情况可以概括大多数工作的工资类别，数目可以在目前工资的基础上多报10%(这是很好解释过去的数目，可用五险一金扣除较多，日常福利，节假日现金红包，购物卡等等搪塞过去)，记得要和简历上写的要相同，具体执行起来很多公司需要提供上家工资流水，所以也要根据自己的情况来解释。由于现在背景调查愈发严格，所以虚报过高的工资容易穿帮，幅度不可过大。\n\n\n# 20.希望待遇多少?\n\n正确回答：刚到公司，还是按照公司的岗位工资我就满意了，后期我想咱们单位应该是能力与待遇成正比的 ，对吗?\n\n【思路】：常被问到希望待遇时，最好能诚实回答，考虑年龄、经验及能力等客观条件来决定，对某些企业而言，这也是评论应征者的能力及经验的参考，一般要求比以前一工作薪水高出百分之十是合理范围。\n\n\n# 21.除了本公司外，还应征了哪些公司?\n\n正确回答：这是我离职以来应聘的第一家单位，之前还没有过求职\n\n【思路】： 这是相当多公司会问的问题，其用意是要概略知道应征者的求职志向，所以这并非绝对是负面答案，就算不便说出公司名称，也应回答“销售同种产品的公司”，如果应征的其他公司是不同业界，容易让人产生无法信任的感觉。\n\n\n# 22.何时可以到职?\n\n正确回答：如果被录用的话，可按公司规定时间上班 【思路】： 大多数企业会关心就职时间，最好是回答“如果被录用的话，可按公司规定时间上班，”但如果还未辞去上一个工作、上班时间又太近，似乎有些强人所难，因为交接至少要一个月的时间，应进一步说明原因，录取公司应该会通融的 正确回答：如果被录用的话，可按公司规定时间上班\n\n\n# 23.你了解我们单位吗\n\n正确回答：之前我在网络上以及朋友的口中了解过咱们单位，咱们单位在网络行业是石家庄的巨头，……… 【思路】 ：只要毕业生提前做些准备，从多种途径收集用人单位的信息，这样的问题就比较容易回答，如果答非所问或张口结舌，场面可能会很尴尬\n\n\n# 24.希望工作地点在哪里?\n\n正确回答：至于工作地点，我会按照单位的需求而定 【思路】： 这是有数个分公司及营业场所的企业会问到的问题，如果有希望的工作地点，可据实说出来，如：现在虽然希望在某营业场所工作，但也可有“将来还是希望能到总公司服务”之类的要求。\n\n\n# 25.你为什么应聘我们单位\n\n正确回答：有两点，一是我对这个行业很感兴趣，二是咱们单位在这个行业里属于领军式企业，对我吸引力很打。 【思路】：毕业生可以从该单位在行业中的地位、自己的兴趣、能力和日后的发展前景等角度回答此问题\n\n\n# 26.你找工作最重要的考虑因素是什么\n\n正确回答：我觉得应该是发展和提升，再者就是公司的培训，每个人都有自己的职业规划和定位，二我的规划就是在这段时间内无论是外职业生涯还是内职业生涯，我希望都有所发展。 【思路】：可以结合你正在应聘的工作，侧重谈你的兴趣、你对于取得事业上的成就的渴望、施展你的才能的可能性、未来的发展前景等方面来谈\n\n\n# 27.你认为你适合什么样的工作\n\n正确回答：我大学的专业是计算机应用，主要学习的是网络方面的知识，在我毕业以后我又进行了网络工程师系统的培训，所以我觉得在网络方面的工作我会做的很好 【思路】：结合你的长处或者专业背景回答，也许单位是结合未来的工作安排来提问，也许只是一般性地了解你对自己的评价，不要说不知道，也不要说什么都行\n\n\n# 28 “你为什么选择我们公司?”\n\n正确回答：在几家应聘单位中我之所以选择咱们公司，是因为看重咱们公司在业内的影响力以及咱们公司的实力 【思路】：\n\n 1. 面试官试图从中了解你求职的动机、愿望以及对此项工作的态度。\n 2. 建议从行业、企业和岗位这三个角度来回答。\n 3. 参考答案——“我十分看好贵公司所在的行业，我认为贵公司十分重视人才，而且这项工作很适合我，相信自己一定能做好。”\n\n\n# 29.您在前一家公司的离职原因是什么?\n\n正确回答：我离职是因为这家公司倒闭。我在公司工作了三年多，有较深的感情。从去年始，由于市场形势突变，公司的局面急转直下。到眼下这一步我觉得很遗憾，但还要面对显示，重新寻找能发挥我能力的舞台。 【思路】：\n\n 1. 最重要的是：应聘者要使找招聘单位相信，应聘者在过往的单位的“离职原因”在此家招聘单位里不存在。\n 2. 避免把“离职原因”说得太详细、太具体。\n 3. 不能掺杂主观的负面感受，如“太幸苦”、“人际关系复杂”、“管理太混乱”、“公司不重视人才”、“公司排斥我们某某的员工”等。\n 4. 但也不能躲闪、回避，如“想换换环境”、“个人原因”等。\n 5. 不能涉及自己负面的人格特征，如不诚实、懒惰、缺乏责任感、不随和等。\n 6. 尽量使解释的理由为应聘者个人形象添彩。\n 7. 同一个面试问题并非只有一个答案，而同一个答案并不是在任何面试场合都有效，关键在于应聘者掌握了规律后，对面试的具体情况进行把握，有意识地揣摩面试官提出问题的心理背景，然后投其所好。\n\n\n# 30.如果我录用你，你认为你在这份工作上会待多久呢?正确回答：\n\na.这问题可能要等我工作一段时间后，才能比较具体地回答。 b.一份工作至少要做3年、5年，才能学习到精华的部分。 c.这个问题蛮难回答的，可能要看当时的情形。 d.至少2年，2年后我计划再出国深造。 【思路】：选择b最多，a次之。b的回答能充分显示出你的稳定性，不过，这必须配合你的履历表上，之前的工作是否也有一致性。a的回答则是非常实际，有些人事主管因为欣赏应征者的坦诚，能够接受这样的回答。\n\n\n# 31.如果你离开现职，你认为你的老板会有什么反应?正确回答\n\na.很震惊，因为老板对我算是很信赖，我就如同他的左右手一样。 b.还好吧，他大概心里也有数，反正公司现在也不忙。 c.他大概习惯了，反正他手下的人来来去去已是司空见惯。 d.我想他一定会生气地破口大骂，他是一个相当情绪化的人。 【思路】：最理想的回答是a。面谈者想借此了解你和前(现)任主管的相处情形，以及你在主管心目中的地位如何?\n\n\n# 32.你为什么还没找到合适的职位呢?正确回答：我是最近刚刚离职\n\n【思路】：别怕告诉他们你可能会有的聘请，千万不要说“我上一次面试弄得一塌糊涂……”。指出这是你第一次面试。\n\n\n# 33.除了工资，还有什么福利最吸引你?\n\n正确回答：对于我来说就是咱们公司的培训。\n\n【思路】：尽可能诚实，如果你做足了功课，你就知道他们会提供什么，回答尽可能和他们提供的相配。如果你觉得自己该得到更多，也可以多要一点\n\n\n# 34.你会为公司服务多久?\n\n正确回答：只要公司与我双方都觉得我在公司运营中发挥作用，在不断成长成熟，在公司实现预期目标中作出贡献，我乐意为公司效力。 【思路】： 把公司的发展与你个人发展结合到一起来说这个问题\n\n\n# 35.你愿意到另外一个城市定居吗?\n\n正确回答：我宁愿留在这里，不过可能的话我会考虑一下。\n\n【思路】： 尽管在某些初次面试中，你也许会被问到许多像这种能代表你利益的问题。尽管这样的问题对一个初次面试的人来说不公平，回答不好的话，你也许什么都得不到，甚至还会失去所有的东西。假如你在初次面试时被突然地问到这样的问题，只需说些如“当然有可能”或者“我愿意考虑一下”之类的话。　后来，如果你得到了这份工作，你会知道具体的工作条件，然后决定你是否愿意接受这个职位。记住，在提供工作阶段，你有大部分的谈判权利，而且雇主也许会很愿意为你提供你所需要的东西。如果那些不成问题，你也许会想说明一下，经过重新考虑，你已决定了不迁往别处，但是你想让雇主知道可以考虑把你安排在其他的在将来开放的职位上。\n\n\n# 36.你为什么对我们的工作职位感兴趣?\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 面试官试图从中了解你求职的动机、愿望以及对此项工作的态度。\n 2. 建议从行业、企业和岗位这三个角度来回答。\n 3. 参考答案——“我十分看好贵公司所在的行业，我认为贵公司十分重视人才，而且这项工作很适合我，相信自己一定能做好。”\n\n\n# 37.“对 这项工作，你有哪些可预见的困难?”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜直接说出具体的困难，否则可能令对方怀疑应聘者不行。\n 2. 可以尝试迂回战术，说出应聘者对困难所持有的态度——“工作中出现一些困难是正常的，也是难免的，但是只要有坚忍不拔的毅力、良好的合作精神以及事前周密而充分的准备，任何困难都是可以克服的。”\n\n\n# 38.你能否胜任?\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 应聘者最好站在招聘单位的角度来回答。\n 2. 招聘单位一般会录用这样的应聘者：基本符合条件、对这份工作感兴趣、有足够的信心。\n 3. 如“我符合贵公司的招聘条件，凭我目前掌握的技能、高度的责任感和良好的饿适应能力及学习能力 ，完全能胜任这份工作。我十分希望能为贵 公司服务，如果贵公司给我这个机会，我一定能成为贵公司的栋梁!\n\n\n# 39.如果msra公司和另一家公司同时给你offer，你怎么办?\n\n【思路】:面试官试图从中了解你求职的动机、愿望以及对此项工作的态度。一般大家都会以公司名气和工资高低作为取舍依据，你如果这样回答：“我会把企业文化、公司发展前景、个人在公司的发展、工作部门、职位、将来的顶头上司和团队成员是什么样的人等因素进行综合分析比较做出结论，决定我的舍取。” 面试官将对你刮目相看。\n\n\n# 40.未来工作中，你想避免些什么?为什么?\n\n【思路】：一：避免出错，尤其是刚开始，慢点没关系，因为开始不熟悉没人怪你，可是你为了追求速度而错误百出就坏了，给人留下老出错的印象后，一有问题大家都会想到你，很痛苦。 二：避免受欺负，新人都会觉得刚来要和同事处理好关系，受欺负也会忍气吞声，错!既然明知道这个人是欺负你，你就要反击，决不示弱!不是你的错硬要怪你的人得罪就得罪，别人心理有数你这样的反击到底对否，不会对你有坏印象，反而会懂得尊重你。 三：不会说话就少说，打招呼不知道说些什么没关系，但是看见了一定要热情，有礼貌，哪怕只是微笑一下。\n\n\n# 41.讲述一些对你的发展贡献最大的事件或事情。请说说你从那些些事件或事故中学到了什么，并且是怎样把所学的知识应用到后来的实际工作中的?\n\n【思路】：这里你所要讲的事情是你遇到的比较积极的事情，比如你看了一位专业成功人士的个人传记，从他的身上懂得了怎么刻苦学习、为人处事、和其他同事的关系以及对工作的狂热，从而运用到自身，把他的经验运用到自己的工作当中，少走了很多弯路，提高了工作效率。\n\n\n# 42.从你的前任工作中，你所学到的最有意义的两到三件事是什么?\n\n【思路】：你这里要说的就是工作心得或是工作经验，比如使你工作效率提高的例子\n\n\n# 43.你是学生物的，为什么不去做生物和医药?\n\n【思路】：这个问题提的很尖锐，迫使你不得不暴露自己在专业上的弱点，你可以这样回答：“我虽然学的是生物专业，但我更喜欢计算机，在校期间，我经常自学这方面的知识，而且两年前，就拿到高级程序员证书。这次又通过职业测评，咨询诊断结果我作销售比较合适，而且我性格开朗，亲和力强，所以，我认为我完全胜任贵公司计算机市场开发工作。”这样，既没有说到对生物不感兴趣，没有学好专业等缺欠，又把咨询师给的合理建议端出，使面试官引起重视。\n\n\n# 三、性格等方面的考察\n\n\n# 44.你有什么业余爱好?\n\n正确回答：说起业余爱好，我还真不是很多 ，除了读书，我就比较喜爱打球，在大学的时候我是我们系篮球队的 ，我打的位置是中锋，不过最近几年因为工作的关系渐渐的打的少了 【思路】：\n\n 1. 业余爱好能在一定程度上反映应聘者的性格、观念、心态，这是招聘单位问该问题的主要原因。 2. 最好不要说自己没有业余爱好。 3. 不要说自己有那些庸俗的、令人感觉不好的爱好。 4. 最好不要说自己仅限于读书、听音乐、上网，否则可能令面试官怀疑应聘者性格孤僻。 5. 最好能有一些户外的业余爱好来“点缀”你的形象。\n\n\n# 45.你最崇拜谁?\n\n正确回答：我最崇拜马云。马云有着超乎常人的市场敏感度，以及对事物把握的精确度也相当的有造诣 【思路】：\n\n 1. 最崇拜的人能在一定程度上反映应聘者的性格、观念、心态，这是面试官问该问题的主要原因。\n 2. 不宜说自己谁都不崇拜。\n 3. 不宜说崇拜自己。\n 4. 不宜说崇拜一个虚幻的、或是不知名的人。\n 5. 不宜说崇拜一个明显具有负面形象的人。\n 6. 所崇拜的人人最好与自己所应聘的工作能“搭”上关系。\n 7. 最好说出自己所崇拜的人的哪些品质、哪些思想感染着自己、鼓舞着自己。\n\n\n# 46.你的座右铭是什么?\n\n正确回答：只为成功找方法，不为失败找借口 【思路】：\n\n 1. 座右铭能在一定程度上反映应聘者的性格、观念、心态，这是面试官问这个问题的主要原因。\n 2. 不宜说那些医引起不好联想的座右铭。\n 3. 不宜说那些太抽象的座右铭。\n 4. 不宜说太长的座右铭。\n 5. 座右铭最好能反映出自己某种优秀品质。\n\n\n# 47.谈谈你的缺点\n\n正确回答：要说缺点，我觉得我这个人有时候很固执，做一件事情的时候，总想按照预定的方向去把他做。 【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜说自己没缺点。\n 2. 不宜把那些明显的优点说成缺点。\n 3. 不宜说出严重影响所应聘工作的缺点。\n 4. 不宜说出令人不放心、不舒服的缺点。\n 5. 可以说出一些对于所应聘工作“无关紧要”的缺点，甚至是一些表面上看是缺点，从工作的角度看却是优点的缺点。\n\n\n# 48.谈谈你的家庭\n\n正确回答：我的父亲是做教师工作，母亲是做财会工作的，从小父母对我的学习情况就特别重视。……….. 【思路】 ：了解求职者的性格、观念、心态等，这是该问题的主要作用 2简单地罗列家庭人口 3强调温馨和睦的家庭氛围 4强调父母对自己教育的重视 5强调各位家庭成员的良好状况 6强调家庭成员对自己工作的支持 7强调自己对家庭的责任感\n\n\n# 49.你会在桌上放什么书?\n\n正确回答：我放一本好的字典在桌上，我也会放一本struck and white，这是一本好的参考书，能查找高中或大学里学过但又忘掉的语法知识，或者在遇到特别困难的情形也可使用。 【思路】 ：招聘者可能有兴趣判定你对你的职业有多重视。一本好字典和好的参考书对于一个从事写作的人来说是手头必备书，你可能也会把喜爱的小说放到桌上。\n\n\n# 50.作为被面试者给我打一下分\n\n正确回答：我觉得您很专业，如果说满分是10分的话 您最少能得9分… 【思路】： 试着列出四个优点和一个非常非常非常小的缺点，(可以抱怨一下设施，没有明确责任人的缺点是不会有人介意的)。\n\n\n# 51.告诉我一些有关你自己的但在你的简历上又没有反映出来的东西\n\n正确回答：你可能不知道我21岁就开始管理自己的网站，我认为你能理解我对投资销售方面的兴趣是重要的。在过去的2年里我平均每年获得12%的盈利。 【思路】：不要只是重复简历上已有的东西，讲讲那些虽与你过去的从业经验无关但能反映你的个性和经验的独特的天赋或技能\n\n\n# 52.谈谈你的星座、血型、八字\n\n【思路】:类问题对于了解应聘者的性格、观念、心态等有一定的作用，这是招聘单位提出该问题的主要原因。回答时要说：“职业是人生最大事，要靠科学的职业生涯规划来科学定位，从而找到各阶段的发展平台。不能相信星座、血型、八字等学说，那样会贻误前途，赔上时间成本。”\n\n\n# 53.请讲一下这样一个经历：尽管其他人反对，但是你还是坚持自己的观点，并把事情继续做下去。\n\n【思路】:从自己积极方面回答,比如家人和老师都希望我报考会计专业,而我对会计就是不感兴趣,毅然选择了动漫专业.我现在毕业,专业技能很强,而且有自己成熟的作品，动漫是我的事业,将继续做下去\n\n\n# 54.你的一位领导脾气比较急，批评下属时常常不留情面，大家的工作情绪经常受到影响。作为职员，你该怎么办?\n\n【思路】:首先对领导的批评应该认真接受，不能因为领导严厉的批评而产生逆反心理，以致影响工作; 其次可以私下找机会和领导沟通，向领导反映下属因此产生的意见和情绪，婉转地说明这种情绪可能会影响工作的正常开展，至于是否接受建议、改变方法，由领导自己决定。\n\n\n# 55.在工作中你的同志不如你，你的工作很出色，而他找出了你的缺点向老板汇报。你将怎么样?\n\n【思路】:找机会与他沟通，谢谢他帮我找到了缺点，让我可以更加正确全面地认识自己。 工作中积极改正缺点，更加精益求精。同时主动帮助他提高工作水平，大家相互学习、共同提高。\n\n\n# 56.你和一个同学同入一个部门，作出的成绩相同。几年后他升迁了，你没动，如何想?\n\n【思路】:一方面认真向他学习、向同事请教，并与自己进行对照，找出自己的不足，积极加以改正; 另一方面也要经常与领导和同事沟通，学会正常的人际交往，同时适时地表现自己，争取改变别人对自己的成见。 四 工作能力考察\n\n\n# 57.你了解我们所招聘的岗位吗 正确回答：有过了解。网络管理员主要是从事公司的网络管理以及维护，包括电脑单机的维护维修，以及网络的周边设备……\n\n【思路】：毕业生针对这样的问题可以从岗位职责和对应聘者的要求两个方面谈起，很多毕业生在这样的问题面前手足无措，其实只要详细阅读单位的招聘信息就可以了\n\n\n# 58.“对这项工作，你有哪些可预见的困难?”正确回答：工作中出现一些困难是正常的，也是难免的，但是只要有坚忍不拔的毅力、良好的合作精神以及事前周密而充分的准备，任何困难都是可以克服的。”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 不宜直接说出具体的困难，否则可能令对方怀疑应聘者不行。\n 2. 可以尝试迂回战术，说出应聘者对困难所持有的态度\n\n\n# 59.“与上级意见不一是，你将怎么办?” 正确回答：首先呢，作为一个员工我的是不会和上级产生争执的，如果真有意见不一致的时候，我想我会服从领导安排的\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 一般可以这样回答“我会给上级以必要的解释和提醒，在这种情况下，我会服从上级的意见。”\n 2. 如果面试你的是总经理，而你所应聘的职位另有一位经理，且这位经理当时不在场，可以这样回答：“对于非原则性问题，我会服从上级的意见，对于涉及公司利益的重大问题，我希望能向更高层领导反映。”\n\n\n# 60.“我们为什么要录用你?” 正确回答：我符合贵公司的招聘条件，凭我目前掌握的技能、高度的责任感和良好的饿适应能力及学习能力 ，完全能胜任这份工作。我十分希望能为贵公司服务，如果贵公司给我这个机会，我一定能成为贵公司的栋梁!”\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 应聘者最好站在招聘单位的角度来回答。\n 2. 招聘单位一般会录用这样的应聘者：基本符合条件、对这份共组感兴趣、有足够的信心\n\n\n# 61.你能为我们做什么?\n\n正确回答：首先我应聘的是网络管理员，如果贵公司能够录用我的话，首先，我会对公司整个网络环境进行净化，对公司的网络安全状况进行加固…………\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 基本原则上“投其所好”。\n 2. 回答这个问题前应聘者最好能“先发制人”，了解招聘单位期待这个职位所能发挥的作用。\n 3. 应聘者可以根据自己的了解，结合自己在专业领域的优势来回答这个问题。\n\n\n# 62.你希望与什么样的上级共事?\n\n正确回答：做为刚步入社会新人，我应该多要求自己尽快熟悉环境、适应环境，而不应该对环境提出什么要求，只要能发挥我的专长就可以了。\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 通过应聘者对上级的“希望”可以判断出应聘者对自我要求的意识，这既上一个陷阱，又上一次机会。\n 2. 最好回避对上级具体的希望，多谈对自己的要求。\n\n\n# 63.你是应届毕业生，缺乏经验，如何能胜任这项工作?\n\n正确回答：作为应届毕业生，在工作经验方面的确会有所欠缺，因此在读书期间我一直利用各种机会在这个行业里做兼职。我也发现，实际工作远比书本知识丰富、复杂。但我有较强的责任心、适应能力和学习能力，而且比较勤奋，所以在兼职中均能圆满完成各项工作，从中获取的经验也令我受益非浅。请贵公司放心，学校所学及兼职的工作经验使我一定能胜任这个职位。\n\n【思路】：\n\n 1. 如果招聘单位对应届毕业生的应聘者提出这个问题，说明招聘单位并不真正在乎“经验”，关键看应聘者怎样回答。\n 2. 对这个问题的回答最好要体现出应聘者的诚恳、机智、果敢及敬业。\n\n\n# 64.你为什么觉得自己能够在这个职位上取得成就?\n\n正确回答： 从我的经历来看，这是我的职业生涯中最适合我的一份工作。几年来，我一直在研究这个领域并且关注贵公司，一直希望能有这样的面试机会。我拥有必备的技能(简单讲述一个故事来加以说明)，我非常适合这一职位，也确实能做好这份工作。\n\n【思路】：这是一个相当宽泛的问题，它给求职者提供了一个机会，可以让求职者表明自己的热情和挑战欲。对这个问题的回答将为面试人在判断求职者是否对这个职位有足够的动力和自信心方面提供关键信息。\n\n\n# 65.你如何规划你个人的职业生涯\n\n正确回答：我对自己进行了一个长期的规划，以及4个短期的规划，现在这个阶段我主要是对自己的内职业生涯进行提升。 【思路】：分长期和短期来进行回答。毕业生在求职前一定要对这样的问题有所考虑，并不仅仅是因为面试时可能被问到，对这个问题的思考有助于为个人树立目标。\n\n\n# 66.你希望5年后达到什么成就?\n\na.做一天和尚敲一天钟，尽人事听天命、顺其自然。\n\nb.依我的机灵及才干，晋升到部门经理是我的中期目标。\n\nc.自己独当一面开公司。\n\nd.“全力以赴”是我的座右铭，希望能随着经验的增加，被赋予更多的职责及挑战。\n\n解答：最理想的回答是d。\n\n\n# 67.为什么你认为你对该行业会保持长久的兴趣?\n\n正确回答：撇开晋升的机会不说，该行业的技术变化得如此快，所以这里有广阔的就业机会。我尤其对多方面应用多媒体作为培训手段感兴趣。 【思路】：你对该行业的发展前景有什么期望或设想?它使你不需晋升就可以获得发展吗?这家企业里什么使你最受鼓舞?你可以提供什么证据来证明你的兴趣来源于你极度的好奇——可能回到几年前的时间去找这个证据——而不是目前这些你可能放弃的一时兴致?\n\n\n# 68.5年之内你想处于什么位置?\n\n正确回答：我希望有机会在工厂或国内办事处工作。我也希望通过管理一个小团体发展我的管理技能。\n\n【思路】：不要给出具体的时限或工作头衔。谈你喜欢的东西，你天生的技能，实际的问题和在你所选的领域或行业里你希望有什么机会，你希望从那些经验中学点什么。不要谈论你在那些与你所应聘的工作无关的领域或行业里的目标。这是听起来很明显的道理，但是很多求职者会犯这个错误。不经意间你就表现出了对当前的领域或行业缺乏真正的兴趣。不用说，一失言马上就会把你从进一步的考虑中淘汰掉。\n\n\n# 69.描述你的理想职业\n\n正确回答：不管发生什么事情，我都愿意在与it有关的领域里工作。和在大学中教学的工作相比，我还是对it感兴趣。但我相信从事it是我的天性，我擅长销售是因为我愿意花时间去教我的客户。现在我热切盼望我能培训那些新招聘进来的人。 【思路】：谈及你喜欢的东西，你天生的技能，实际的问题或在这份特定工作或行业里你所期盼的机会，你希望从那些经验里学点什么东西。避免谈具体的时限和工作头衔。\n\n\n# 70.如果你有无限的时间和经济来源，你会怎样使用它们呢?\n\n正确回答：我希望能参加几次不针对金融专家的有关金融管理的行政研讨会。我还希望能让我的部门放长假，把每一个人都派去参加外界的一些活动。最后，我很可能去旅游并考察一下外国竞争者，同时一路享受当地的美食，您呢? 【思路】：虽然娱乐的事情谈起来很有诱惑力，但一定要紧扣工作或与行业相关的事务，或者紧扣与你应聘的这份工作的技能相关的努力上。例如，你正在应聘教书工作，你可能对义务教授成年人读书识字的项目感兴趣。这就证明了你对自己的工作领域的激情，即对教育重要性的一种信仰，即使是作为一种兴趣而毫无报酬都无所谓 71.告诉我你了解这家公司的什么正确回答：在这之前，我曾听朋友谈及过咱们公司，对咱们公司的大概情况进行了一个简单的了解。 【思路】：描述你第一次或是近来邂逅该公司或其产品及其服务的情况。是什么促使你想在那里工作而不是在另一家不同的公司里做同样类型的工作呢?招聘者会仔细观察反映你真正兴趣的方面，而不仅是你对该公司所做的一些表面上的调查了解。把公司的年度报告背出来不大可能会给招聘者留下印象，但把来自顾客和员工的一些反馈意见说出来可能会给招聘者留下印象。\n\n\n# 72.你是怎么知道我们招聘这个职位的呢?\n\n正确回答：一个朋友告诉我的，他是咱们公司xx部门的，我们是大学同学。 【思路】：如果你是从公司内部某人处打听回来的消息，记得提及他的名字，公司不说偏袒内部关系不代表它不存在。\n\n\n# 73.这份工作哪些方面吸引你?哪些方面令你感到还不满意?\n\n正确回答：首先，贵公司在业内是属于领军式的企业，我觉得这样一个企业是值得我去为之而奋斗的……….. 【思路】：列举3个以上这份工作吸引你的因素;但，对于后一个问题给一个微不足道的小缺陷，轻描淡写，点到即止。\n\n\n# 74.假如现在是你在我们公司做首次年度总结，我该告诉你一些什么呢?\n\n正确回答：您要感谢我把工作完成得很好，并说明您渴望能够继续看到我工作的好成绩。更重要的是，我希望您能告诉我，您很欣赏我为一些重要项目加班加点工作的行为，还有我富有创造性的思维是如何有助于对存在的问题提出改革方案的。 【思路】：很明显，在回答该问题时，你想给人留下积极的印象。“但愿您能更准时地出现”绝对不是一个好答案。记住，重点谈一两点你个人的优势。\n\n\n# 75.为什么你想在这里工作?\n\n正确回答：我几年前就错过了你们公司的一次招标，之后我意识到电脑产品变得越来越相近了，且零售价格的竞争愈趋激烈，以致服务成为了一家公司在竞争中脱颖而出的最好的方法。贵公司在所有的竞争者中享有最好的服务记录，而我相信从长远看，它将主宰这个行业。你的准备和调查研究工作应在这里明显表现出来。 【思路】：给出一到两个你对该公司感兴趣的原因，并表明什么最激发你的兴趣。什么是你可以叙述来表明你个人对该公司的认识的最有说服力的事情呢?它的产品还是它的员工?答案包括公司的信誉、对该工作本身的描述，或者是跻身于该企业的欲望。\n\n\n# 76.你从我们公司的顾客、员工，或者别人那儿了解了我们公司的一些什么情况?\n\n正确回答：我确实给你们小册子上提到的几个客户打过电话。我与之交谈的顾客中有两人解释了他们为什么年复一年地购买你们的产品。你们的供销运作是很棒的，但还有没有一些可提高的服务项目呢? 【思路】：-叙述通过你个人与公司代表们的接触后，你的兴趣又是如何增长的。为面试进行而富有创造性地思考。例如，在你面试之前，和一些零售商或公司生产线上别的供销点的工人交谈。他们能告诉你一些什么?给出一到两个你所了解到的例子来解释你为什么对这家公司感兴趣。什么是你可以用来证明你兴趣的最有力的例子?\n\n\n# 77.我们为什么要聘请你呢?\n\n正确回答：　“我在这个领域的经验很少人比得上，而且我的适应能力使我确信我能把职责带上一个新的台阶”。 【思路】：这个问题听起来既消极又可疑，或者十分刻薄。但实际上，面试官是想让你帮助他聘用你。你拥有他们需要的才识，经验，能力和技能，他们要找的正是你。\n\n\n# 78.你对加班的看法。\n\n正确回答：首先我想确认下，是何种性质的加班? 如果是我个人的工作量是在规定的时间内没有完成的话，这种情况是不会发生的，我是个注重工作效率的人。其次如果是公司业务量临时增加的话，我会接受加班。 【思路】：首先，明确的告诉对方，如果是因为自己在规定的时间内没有完成工作任务的话 ，需要加班的情况是几乎不可能出现的，“我是个注重工作效率的人”其次，如果是因为公司业务情况或者其他的一些紧急工作的话是可以适应加班的。\n\n\n# 79.经常需要出差的工作适合你的生活方式吗?\n\n正确回答：对我或我的家庭来说，这种经常需要出差的顾问工作是完全没有问题的。\n\n\n# 80.就你的能力而言，如何让我相信你能够胜任这份工作?\n\n正确回答：就我之前的工作经验而言，我觉得我能够胜任这份工作，网络管理员主要负责公司内部局域网的……..，我在以前的单位，做的正是这些。\n\n【思路】：这个问题要从所应聘的岗位职责和要求入手，阐述你在这方面的实力\n\n\n# 81.你的应变能力如何?\n\n正确回答：举个例子：在06年年底，这是个考察求职者的创造力和主动性的问题。举一个你如何改变计划或方向并且取得同样或更好效果的例子。你要侧重谈你怎样获得至关重要的信息或者是你如何改变个人作风获得与别人合作的机会\n\n\n# 四、团队精神\n\n\n# 82.团结是做好各项工作的基础。你如果是其中一员，对搞好本项目组团结有什么想法和打算?\n\n【思路】:l.要搞好一个组的团结，组长是关键。作为一名组员，要把维护和增强项目组团结作为协助组长工作的一项重要内容。2.正确处理本项目组组长成员之间的关系，积极搞好项目组的团结，为其他工作人员搞好团结作出表率。3.正确运用批评与自我批评的武器，及时纠正错误\n\n\n# 83.你能给公司带来什么?\n\n【思路】:一般外企很想知道未来的员工能为企业做什么，求职者应再次重复自己的优势，然后说：“就我的能力，我可以做一个优秀的员工在组织中发挥能力，给组织带来高效率和更多的收益”。外企喜欢求职者就申请的职位表明自己的能力，比如申请营销之类的职位，可以说：“我可以开发大量的新客户，同时，对老客户做更全面周到的服务，开发老客户的新需求和消费。”等等。\n\n\n# 84.你认为怎样才算一个好的团队者?\n\n【思路】:大家目标一致、齐心协力、互相学习、互相帮助、为团队贡献自己每一份力量，我认为这样的团队才是一个好的团队\n\n\n# 85怎样看待朋友越多越好?\n\n【思路】:不可否认，就如社会上所言，朋友多了好走路。但我认为，交友要慎，要在本职工作的基础上交朋友。一是要多与领导和同事交朋友，多交流、多谈心，沟通思想，增进了解，互相支持，形成合力，其根本是加强团结，从而促进工作的顺利开展。同时时刻正确衡量自己，职人之长，补己之短。二是要多与工作联系单位的同志交朋友，以诚为本，以诚相待、以礼相待\n\n\n# 五、工作主动性\n\n\n# 86.你期望的工资是多少?\n\n【思路】企业的工资水平是很灵活的，何种能力拿何种工资。企业喜欢直率的人，但这个问题却不能正面回答，企业希望听到：“以我的能力和我的优势，我完全可以胜任这个职位，我相信我可以做得很好。但是贵公司对这个职位的描述不是很具体，我想还可以延后再讨论”。企业欢迎求职者给其定薪的自由度，而不是咬准一个价码。\n\n\n# 87.就你申请的这个职位，你认为你还欠缺什么?\n\n【思路】:企业喜欢问求职者弱点，但精明的求职者一般不直接回答。他们希望看到这样的求职者：继续重复自己的优势，然后说：“对于这个职位和我的能力来说，我相信自己是可以胜任的，只是缺乏经验，这个问题我想我可以进入公司以后以最短的时间来解决，我的学习能力很强，我相信可以很快融入公司的企业文化，进入工作状态。”企业喜欢能够巧妙地躲过难题的求职者。\n\n\n# 88.说说你对行业、技术发展趋势的看法?\n\n【思路】:企业对这个问题很感兴趣，只有有备而来的求职者能够过关。求职者可以直接在网上查找对你所申请的行业部门的信息，只有深入了解才能产生独特的见解。企业认为最聪明的求职者是对所面试的公司预先了解很多，包括公司各个部门，发展情况，在面试回答问题的时候可以提到所了解的情况，企业欢迎进入企业的人是“知己”，而不是“盲人”。\n\n\n# 89.你认为你在学校属于好学生吗?\n\n【思路】:企业的招聘者很精明，问这个问题可以试探出很多问题：如果求职者学习成绩好，就会说：“是的，我的成绩很好，所有的成绩都很优异。当然，判断一个学生是不是好学生有很多标准，在学校期间我认为成绩是重要的，其他方面包括思想道德、实践经验、团队精神、沟通能力也都是很重要的，我在这些方面也做得很好，应该说我是一个全面发展的学生。”如果求职者成绩不尽理想，便会说：“我认为是不是一个好学生的标准是多元化的，我的学习成绩还可以，在其他方面我的表现也很突出，比如我去很多地方实习过，我很喜欢在快节奏和压力下工作，我在学生会组织过××活动，锻炼了我的团队合作精神和组织能力。” 有经验的招聘者一听就会明白，企业喜欢诚实的求职者。\n\n\n# 90.有人说“成功是对人有益的”，也有人说“失败是对人有益的”，你怎么看?\n\n【思路】:成功是对努力的一种回报，一种肯定，能使人们认识到自身的价值，对自身是一种动力，能激发人们继续创新、学习的勇气!当然，成功是对人有益的。 “失败是对人有益的”，俗话说“失败乃成功之母”，它给予人们更多的是经验与坚韧顽强的精神和永不认输的斗志，所以说“失败是对人有益的”。 这类题的应对方法：辩证地看、联系地看，肯定一方但不否定另一方，两者是有机的统一\n\n\n# 91你在办公室工作的时侯，有各类传真电话和公开电话打进来(咨询程序，有外地单位的人员要过来参观学习。。。具体事务记不清了)，你如何处理这些电话?\n\n【思路】:根据事情的轻重缓急和是否属于自己的职责范围内来处理。(1)职责范围内且能够解决的，自己解决。(2)职责范围内但不能解决的，请示解决。(3)职责范围外不能解决的，转交解决。\n\n\n# 92.如何主持一次会议?\n\n【思路】:1)确定主题，议题，准备好相关的材料。(2)确定时间、地点、参加人及应邀请的领导嘉宾。(3)安排议程，顺序，并安排好食宿。(4)经领导同意后发邀请函。(5)安排好会场(主席台，台标等)及报到处。(6)安排好主席人，报告人，发言人，及记录人员。(7)会后整理好资料，向领导做一次情况汇报。\n\n\n# 93.如果我们单位录用了你，但工作一段时间却发现你根本不适合这个职位你怎么办?\n\n【思路】:一段时间发现工作不适合我，有两种情况：1.如果你确实热爱这个职业，那你就要不断学习，虚心向领导和同事学习业务知识和处事经验，了解这个职业的精神内涵和职业要求，力争减少差距;2.你觉得这个职业可有可无，那还是趁早换个职业，去发现适合你的，你热爱的职业，那样你的发展前途也会大点，对单位和个人都有好处。，\n\n\n# 六、适应能力\n\n\n# 94.请谈谈你个人的最大特色。\n\n【思路】:a.我人缘极佳，连续3年担任班委。 b.我的坚持度很高，事情没有做到一个令人满意的结果，绝不罢手。 c.我非常守时，工作以来，我从没有迟到过。 d.我的个性很随和，是大家公认的好好先生(小姐)。 解答：这题理想的回答是b。a、c、d虽然都表示出应征者个性上的优点，但只有b的回答，最能和工作结合，能够与工作表现相结合的优点、特质，才是面谈者比较感兴趣的回答。\n\n\n# 95.你是否愿意从基层做起?\n\n【思路】:主要考察应聘者是否是一个踏实肯干而非眼高手低的人。职场新人可以表示自己愿意从基层开始锻炼自己\n\n\n# 96.现代人际关系非常重要，你对此有何看法?\n\n【思路】:现代人际关系就是搞好工作、实现自我价值的一个重要因素。如果人际关系不好，就会感到苦恼，一旦陷入苦恼中，还会有精力做好工作吗?所以我认为，要搞好工作，决不能忽视人际关系。\n\n\n# 97.当某件事老是没有结果是，你该怎样做?\n\n【思路】:首先自己换位思考把前因、过程分析一下，另外请教专业人士。如果自己做法错误马上改正，如果方法不对改变方式\n\n\n# 98.你如何看待你所应聘的岗位?\n\n【思路】:各个岗位在责任、权利、利益、分工、合作、技能、技巧等方面，都有明显的要求，而这往往是区别于其他岗位的，每个岗位都有其对员工的特殊性，在专业化日益增强的今天，“万金油”式的人越来越不被看好。所以，你切不可说“我能干这也能干那”，而应明晰在管理的半径、层面、空间上是有着很大差别的。有人往往在此时急求事功，在未详细了解岗位的具体要求情况下仓促应允，以为自己什么都干得了，这不明智，而且容易招致面试方反感。该岗位需要的所有内容，正是面试者想从你这里听到的，你也只需照此行事即可。\n\n\n# 99.假如让你干一项工作，这个工作估计一周就能够完成。干了几天后，你发现，即使干上三周也没法完成这个任务。你该怎样处理这种情形?为什么?\n\n【思路】:发现及时向领导反映,说明其真实情况,如果领导说可以延长那你把大概完成时间向领导汇报,但领导说不能延长时间,那你就请求领导增加人手,确保在要求时间内完成。\n\n\n# 100.讲一个这样的经历：本来是你自己的工作，但别人却给你提供了很多帮助。\n\n【思路】:切记千万不要说因自己无能,别人来帮助;可以说时间紧或让提前完成,没有办法请他人帮助。',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/05/08

这里其实也是解释了为什么很多学生进入职场后的头几个月(主要是在大公司)基本都是被放养，不是领导对你有意见，是真的没空关注你太细，毕竟领导不是老师，没有义务教你那么多，咱得自己主动多问，交代的任务做好来，多主动汇报(刷存在感)。\n\n所以只能通过让员工述职的方式集中式的了解员工的情况。所以别一听到就觉得如临大敌，感觉自己啥也没干，这一年白干了云云。做到避免自我PUA，然后开始思考该如何给自己多贴金。\n\n\n# 总体思路\n\n下面开始说说总体的思路。年终汇报的核心思想一定要回归到事情的本质，就是让领导了解自己一年都干了啥。有时候HR那边或者公司领导会出一个统一的汇报主题，看似好像是让大家套，实际上一定要重点围绕自己干了啥，千万别在主题上钻牛角尖。整体思路上要多筛选工作亮点，稍微夸大，必须要在做1说1(做了必说,但不是鸡毛蒜皮的事)的基础上，往1:1.5上靠，个别重要的甚至可以吹到2都没问题。总的来说表达的度要自己把握，且结合领导对于你业务的了解程度(很多领导也是听个架势，自己其实不懂)来调整。最后还有一个重点就是，一定要在自己的表述中挖坑，刻意留好坑，是为了让领导问问题时往里跳，潜移默化的引导领导的发问方向，这样可以极大的增强回答问题时的表现，也可以防止被问倒(很多HR领导不懂业务，但会一本正经的问一些很业余，没法回答但又听起来很唬人的问题)。\n\n\n# 具体操作\n\n细化到操作上，首先建议大家平时养成任务归档的习惯，新任务全部按 时间+任务名称 的格式新建文件夹并存放好关键项目文件，这样到了年底，一条看过去就会发现总会有几十个事情的，这就直接为我们的汇报提供了结构清晰的素材库，几十个项目内容，简单的就合并显做的事情多，有含金量的就拆解显得贡献巨大。",normalizedContent:"#

对方公司给不起那么高\n\n就说工资不是最主要的，吹一波，就说您这边给我安排即可（先拿到Offer，才有倒逼的空间），这类公司可以在谈报道日期时适当拖长，因为他们给的少，变相理亏，低于了行业平均跳槽薪资增幅。\n\n\n# 对方说给起来没问题\n\n最终还是让其安排去即可。\n\n\n#

可以说：贵司您招人是比较谨慎的，我对行情也不是太了解，但我有很多的的朋友、以及我的女朋友、亲戚等在这个城市上班，他们的薪资大多数都在1w2、1w5甚至2w以上的也有，所以我对贵司的岗位期望有个万把一两千的样子，9000块确实太低了，1w1也行。我跟您直接说了，9000的样子我就算答应你了，我的家人也会不答应呀。所以就算我的一个小小请求，能不能帮我申请一下。\n\n最终的结果可能会给个10500的样子，这种情况就先收着。\n\n\n# 第二个Offer\n\n第二个公司开始谈工作的时候，就拿第一家公司的工资来谈（说自己当前工资1w1），期望薪资按1W1的多30%-60%来报，也可以拿之前的Offer来说，这种涨幅不大的Offer一般都不会要你的流水来看，如果对方要，就拿Offer来顶替流水。这样子就可以谈到1w4到1w6之间的offer了。\n\n\n# 第三个Offer\n\n按照第二个公司的谈法来，开口直接报，我目前薪资1W4，期望有个30%-60%的增幅。对方可能会惊讶说你之前工资不是才1W吗，怎么突然变得这么高。\n\n> 回复方法：您公司招人是比较谨慎的，我找工作也是，我已经好久不找工作了，不瞒您说从企业招人的角度，我符合岗位的工作年限的要求，我的学历也是达标的，也通过了部门主管的面试现在来谈工资了。工资也是能达到公司的预算之内，不瞒您说贵司是我面试的第二家公司，在之前我面试了一家在之后也面试了一家，这两家公司都对我有意向，也准备下午给我发Offer，他们给的工资挺高的，如果您这边需要，我回家后截个图给您看一下。麻烦学姐、学长帮我争取一下。\n> \n> 如果对方啪的一下把电话挂了，是想勾引你去找他，这时候不用理会，一般三四天后会回复你。\n\n结果是如果内部对方谈OK了，可能会给你18500的样子。\n\n之后的Offer如果有机会可以照常操作。2w一下的工作不需要太担心试用期，及时试用期不过也可以把之前的offer舔回来。\n\n高工资的工作一定要呆一段时间，消除自己的低工资惯性，简历职业自信。\n\n\n# 时间倒逼法\n\n *

21000怎么凑整？啊不行23000，24000，25000也行，打工人养家糊口不容易呀。\n\n报工资的各类概率：\n\n10%：远高于预期，达到当前薪资的200%以上\n\n70%：比当前薪资高30%~60%\n\n15%：跟当前薪资持平或增幅＜20%\n\n5%：比当前薪资还低\n\n如果遇到开价比当前公司还低的公司（假设9000），且故意让你面试多轮，没必要撕破脸皮，\n\n> 可以说：贵司您招人是比较谨慎的，我对行情也不是太了解，但我有很多的的朋友、以及我的女朋友、亲戚等在这个城市上班，他们的薪资大多数都在1w2、1w5甚至2w以上的也有，所以我对贵司的岗位期望有个万把一两千的样子，9000块确实太低了，1w1也行。我跟您直接说了，9000的样子我就算答应你了，我的家人也会不答应呀。所以就算我的一个小小请求，能不能帮我申请一下。\n\n最终的结果可能会给个10500的样子，这种情况就先收着。\n\n\n# 第二个offer\n\n第二个公司开始谈工作的时候，就拿第一家公司的工资来谈（说自己当前工资1w1），期望薪资按1w1的多30%-60%来报，也可以拿之前的offer来说，这种涨幅不大的offer一般都不会要你的流水来看，如果对方要，就拿offer来顶替流水。这样子就可以谈到1w4到1w6之间的offer了。\n\n\n# 第三个offer\n\n按照第二个公司的谈法来，开口直接报，我目前薪资1w4，期望有个30%-60%的增幅。对方可能会惊讶说你之前工资不是才1w吗，怎么突然变得这么高。\n\n> 回复方法：您公司招人是比较谨慎的，我找工作也是，我已经好久不找工作了，不瞒您说从企业招人的角度，我符合岗位的工作年限的要求，我的学历也是达标的，也通过了部门主管的面试现在来谈工资了。工资也是能达到公司的预算之内，不瞒您说贵司是我面试的第二家公司，在之前我面试了一家在之后也面试了一家，这两家公司都对我有意向，也准备下午给我发offer，他们给的工资挺高的，如果您这边需要，我回家后截个图给您看一下。麻烦学姐、学长帮我争取一下。\n> \n> 如果对方啪的一下把电话挂了，是想勾引你去找他，这时候不用理会，一般三四天后会回复你。\n\n结果是如果内部对方谈ok了，可能会给你18500的样子。\n\n之后的offer如果有机会可以照常操作。2w一下的工作不需要太担心试用期，及时试用期不过也可以把之前的offer舔回来。\n\n高工资的工作一定要呆一段时间，消除自己的低工资惯性，简历职业自信。\n\n\n# 时间倒逼法\n\n * 要出国留学，父母安排的，要1年后才能来报道。\n * 目前公司要安排我出国工作半年，要明年才能来报道。\n * 家里人突然生重病，需要照顾很长一段时间，最快可能也要半年后来报告。\n\n对方公司：只好发个邮件来取消offer（变成了他们拒绝了我）\n\n> 这样谈判就变成了：\n> \n> 实在抱歉呀，你是个好人，好公司，但是我们现在没法处关系，发好人卡，为以后舔回来留空间。\n> \n> 虽然是拒绝对方，但也要变成最后是对方拒绝了我。\n\n\n# 工资倒逼法\n\n对之前工资低的offer的倒逼，综合考量，根据公司评分表确定一个主要需要倒逼的公司。\n\n> 公司的offer是有保密性质的，不要轻易发，要发先发微信沟通截图，或者offer的工资那句话\n\n我可能不能来了，我的一个学姐学长约我和他们的领导聊了聊，聊了之后直接决定要我，工资上给的比较高，能不能。。。",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2024/01/26

前言\n\n人生中很多事情，是有很大的内在难度和挑战的，所以在这时候不要过度高估自己的能耐。很多时候自己摸索，是非常不容易的，古代的太子、靖王、景王，资源那么丰富，都需要军师。说明靠着自己“冥思苦想”，是没有结果的，等同于“闭门造车"。这点上，男孩和男性最容易被传统思维误导，他们被书本教条和名人传记中的榜样力量所激励，碰到问题时喜欢自己一个去想方法,这就是成功学教育对人长期的荼毒的结果。\n\n其实“想方法”，大概率就等于个屁，只能想出不切实际的馊主意，最终自己倒逼自己，“拼一把”，从而坚持到底就是失败，这个人生就再也没能爬得起来。\n\n这其中的破解之道其实就是正确的应用唯物辩证法，破除形而上认知的误导。\n\n其实道理是非常简单的，你在某一个困难面前踌躇不前，无非就是A不做选择、B C D三个选择。你的问题是你只知道从bc两个选项中二者必居其一，但你不知道还有个c选项，且你没有想过维持现状即a也是一种选择。\n\n对你最大的挑战还不是“选哪个”，而是选择A、B、C、D中某一个方案后，第二天会各自有什么不同，以及接下来的结果是什么样子，当初A、B、C、D对应的一个月后会产生的结果A1、B1...... ,一年后的状态A2、B2、......又是样子，接着3年5年甚至10年后，A3 B3 C3.....，又是什么样子。\n\n总之，类似4个选择，对应未来比如36种结果，你现在的势商只能想到选b还是选c，其他38个你一无所知，面对38/40也就是95%的未知，你当然想不出来确信的、有用的、未来不后悔的方案。这也是那么多人说"要是早几年认识幽哥，我怎么怎么样""就不会像现在这么发展""就不会像现在这么低薪""就不是现在这个老公/老婆"的原因。\n\n你现在感慨的所谓醍醐灌顶、相见恨晚，只是当初你不知道自己有更多的选择，也不知道该选哪一个，这才是势商的作用。光有智商、情商还没用，你球技再好、避开了狡猾的对手、一路狂飙，但你将球踢进了自家的球门，这叫自摆乌龙，算-1分。\n\n在这篇《男女求职思维的不同点》中，我们可以知晓男女追求答案的异同点。用到东北深圳美女小雨这里，我如果接受指导你，就类似将你走十年弯路才能体验出来的心得，浓缩成3-6个月提前告诉你，我这样的师长所起的作用，则是节约你九年半的青春。\n\n大家看下小雨自己求职2年的时候，下图，尽管也是在职寻求跳槽机会，但没跳得动，连面试电话都寥寥。其实这第一步可以通过简单方法就可以实现，你看《为何投简历后一个面试电话也没有？好不容易来了个垃圾公司的邀请，还紧张得要死！》。\n\n差不多在4个月后，她已经从3-4个年薪50万上下的Offer当中，选择一个跳过去上班大半个月了。此时，某天上午她继续通过了一家500强外企的终试，且下午还有一家央企的面试，而这两家她的开价自然是60-80万。 细节方面，当然不是我教她试用期继续投递简历的，而是之前投出去的简历继续发挥了作用。\n\n这样一个从996不断加班的工作制下，短期3-5个月内年薪翻倍去新单位上班的过程，就是对以资本论为实质内核框架的现代社会的反向利用。\n\n\n# 正文\n\n说了这么多，才回归今天要说的主题，也就是主业提升之外的第二类报喜，生涯发展类的好消息。\n\n这中同际了副业收入之外，报吾最多的就是厉产，类似如下的消息，我几乎每周都会收到。\n\n我不知道他、她有没有告诉父母说背后有个幽哥的作用，估计跟年薪翻倍跳槽的人类似，大多数没说。\n\n\n\n具体这位学弟王兵从湖南毕业，也才本科毕业一年多，在杭州工作。\n\n如下你看下他目前的工资。他这是进群早，大三就进了群，反复被我的思维耳濡目染，这才有这样的悟性。\n\n\n\n我们说“到底如何买房？\n\n这跟“到底如何工作？”是一样的。\n\n你的工作，第一要务是学会获得工作的能力，无论进体制内还是体制外，你先要明白进入的方法；其次，是追求同样成本付出下最高的工资和最大的收益，其实就是学会谈工资、倒逼法；第三，才是之前你认为最重要的具体某个岗位上的工作技能。\n\n你在老家月薪两三千时拿着一份英文报纸背某个单词，你是无法实现去外企500强获得高薪、发展职业的。用战术上的勤劳和外表的自欺人，来弥补战略上你的无知和懒惰，这是绝大多数人贫困一生的原因。\n\n我们买房也是如此，你最要花功夫的不是去看房子门朝南还是朝北、精装修还是毛坯、周围有没有超市……这些是第三步的战术，你别本末倒置。\n\n\n# 第一步：买不买房\n\n买房第一步，叫做买不买房。\n\n“买”这个字是核心，是最大的战略。\n\n学弟王兵2019年6月毕业时根据我的经验海投去了杭州，年薪十万。他毕业前就看了我的文章，比如这篇《第一套房，首付款一般是怎么来的？》，心中已经有数，他知道首付款靠工资显然是来不及积累的。\n\n继续，在他毕业大半年时，准确的说是2020年4 月，看了这篇《女孩买婚前第一套房，如何向亲戚借钱才能提高成功概率？》。此时他杭州没有买房资格，但他已经准备尽早买房，他完成了第一步“准备买”的问题。我当时这篇教大家如何凑首付，解决了"怎么买"中最难的钱的问题。\n\n他毕业半年多，也就余下了勉强5万，但是80万的房子首付需要25万，无非就是问亲友、叔叔阿姨、同学同事等海借个20万，这不是难事。\n\n为何不选择杭州？这就是买房第二步需要解决的问题。2017年我的文章《南通会不会并入上海？（看完，少走20年弯路）》早就为他避免了弯路，给了他这方面的势商。\n\n就拿买房目的地来说，可以归纳出王兵自己此时的三座城市优先排序：一买身边的一线城市上海的房子，二所在的发达二线城市杭州，三老家省会长沙。\n\n很明显，上海他没购房资格，钱也完全不够；杭州还需要一年多才有资格买，且房款也不够，总价都300万的；本科毕业一年能买的当然是家乡所在的省会长沙。\n\n\n# 第二步：买哪里\n\n于是凑到了25万，首付长沙房子在我这篇“海借”文章出炉后的第二个月2020年5月，成为了现实。这步解决的是买房的第二个问题，“买哪里”。\n\n至于买长沙房子时买哪个小区、靠不靠近地铁站、买新房还是二手房等等，那就是他个人要去花心思去尝试和选择的小问题了。前两步战略我这个幽哥算买房师父，已经给你指明了方向和方法。\n\n当然，还有个买房的时机问题，在去年的2月1号，我甚至都指出了最近几年有个房价低点，就是疫情出现到2020年下半年之间。去年我都写了五六篇文章来提及这个判断了，最早的你看2月的《疫情后，职场人的机遇与挑战》，3月的《谈下疫情下的房产以及购房心得》，小截图如下。\n\n\n\n我写得很明确，武汉被疫情影响较深，房价的低点在2020年的10-12月，其他地方尤其一二三线城市，低点则是在2020年的4-9月。\n\n包括《2020到2022，甚至2025年前的经济增长率如何？房价会如何发展？》《春节后看下房价》等文章，我甚至在2020年9月底，模拟出来了未来1年到5年的经济增长率、房价在疫情后的这波上涨启动时间、什么时候结束，等等。这些就是势商。\n\n以上给出了买房时机的建议，具体群友王兵们，就是赶在2020年的5月到12月之间买了房的，这叫抓住了这次势商。\n\n大家注意下，无论是你的职业人生还是副业与买房，我幽哥解决的叫战略，影响你的一生，但是大量的人却是来问：“幽哥，我简历上这句如何措辞？”“领导刚刚这句话是什么意思？”“买长沙哪个新盘""精装修能不能买？"…\n\n你这是对我的战略作用视而不见，且将我大材小用了。另外，我哪有时间给你分析武汉、长沙还是天津的某套房子，我的职场徒弟和那个2万元咨询费的生活伙伴，指导也没这么细。\n\n\n# 第三步：如何挑房\n\n当然，买房第三步是"如何挑房？"这步也不是不重要，只不过这只是战术。\n\n接下来，分享下房产行业资深群友葫芦的挑房子心得，这是"到底如何买房"的第三部分。\n\n> 标题：如何选房子？\n> \n> 作者：葫芦\n\n对于许多人来说，买房都是人生中的大事，也是投资理财、资产保值的一个重要手段，甚至是解决户口及居住问题的一个必要方法。那么，如何挑选合适的房子呢？本身葫芦在房地产也有10年的行业经验，然后自己也有过几次买房经验，现在分享给大家。\n\n\n# 一、地段\n\n买房子最重要的首先就是地段。大家都知道一个商品一旦出售，它本身是不断在贬值的，但是我们会发现一个奇怪的现象，无论房产无论新旧，它都是不断的升值的，这是为什么呢？实际上本质原因是，因为地价在不断的上涨，房价增值的部分其实就是土地的溢价值。\n\n所以，房产价值的核心就是地段。这里也特别说明一点，就目前整个房地产市场行情，越是优质的地段，就越是优质的资产。那么在未来抗风险的能力就会越强，因此，也推荐大家尽量选择地段好的房子。\n\n地段好的房子，有几个核心的要素：学区、商圈、交通、医院配套等。\n\n# 1. 学区\n\n我国自古重视教育，为孩子教育不惜代价，古有“孟母三迁”，今有“学区房”。学区房是未来升值潜力、抗风险能力最强的房产之一。\n\n但是，不同的地区教育制度也在改革，入学政策时有变化。所以，购买学区房的时候，要重点关注区域教育部门的入学政策。\n\n比如，有的地区是小学按学区划分，然后中学摇号的话，那就是只有小学学区。有的地区则是，初中阶段按学区片区入学了，那么便初中的学区。如果有小学和初中都带的学区则更好。现在各地的入学政策各有不同，也在不断变化之中，所以购买学区房，重点关注地区所属的政策，直接影响学区房的价值。\n\n# 2. 商圈\n\n商圈这一块，有购物中心、商圈，生活便利，地段繁华也是好地段的特征之一。还有特别好的企业或机关单位的附近的小区，也是高潜力增长地区。因为未来在这工作的人普遍高收入，较高的社会地位，直接会拉动这个区域发展。\n\n比如说，曾经有开发商专门在北京的互联网大厂附近建小区，项目房价不断翻番，甚至创建了该开发商高端系房产产品，为其后来布局全国打下基础。这可是成就了一个企业，更别说个人了。\n\n# 3. 交通\n\n出行这块，交通便利程度也很关键。上下班是否方便，离公司多远，地铁口、公交车站是否直达，距离高铁站、机场的距离等，决定了以后你未来生活出行方便，是生活便利程度的重要参考。而且一般来说交通便利的地方，小区的位置一般都不错。\n\n# 4. 医院\n\n这里重点说下医院，看病、体检方便，毕竟健康很重要。好的三甲医院附近，未来都是紧俏资源。尤其是我国未来老龄化人口不断激增，这块需求会不断增加。\n\n特别是有实力的富裕阶层，到达一定年龄后，为了自己的身体健康和方便，会优先考虑医院附近的优质房产。有较高的购买能力，同时也是一种健康生存需求，这块的资产的溢价值也会比较高。\n\n\n# 二、楼栋位置\n\n根据地段选定区域项目后，就是项目楼栋挑选问题。一般最好不要买临街和带底商的楼栋。靠近路边有噪音，比较吵，灰尘也大，空气质量差。底层有商业还容易有装修纠纷、油烟污染、人员杂不安全等问题。\n\n一般来说，小区楼栋越靠近中心景观的位置，楼栋价钱会越高，如果排除不选街边的话，那么就根据自己的购买能力，在小区内部选择合适的就好了。\n\n\n# 三、户型\n\n选择户型，先根据实际需要，选择合适的户型大小。然后，朝向上尽量选坐北朝南，这样无论是日照、风向都比较理想，满足冬暖夏凉的要求。朝北就完全反过来了，最好不选。\n\n户型选择上，尽量要选择方正的户型。现在流行一些奇葩的设计，然后导致户型缺角或者不规则形状的房间，这种实际上是非常不好用，风水寓意也不佳。从设计和空间利用的角度来说，户型越方正，空间的利用率就会越高，得房率也会越高。\n\n经历过的项目，比如八十多米平户型，如果是户型方正和布局合理的话，高层双电梯，房屋公摊系数可以控制在10%~12%，这样的比例是非常可观的，光套内的面积就达到七十多个平方米。\n\n整个的房间及布局会很好用，这样的房子在未来的二手房出手时也会更好卖，好议价。方正的户型，装修上成本也会更节约，室内设计空间动线更有选择性，也方便拓展改建。要是讲究些，用于自住的话，也可以请合适的风水先生来帮看一下，做些专业的咨询，风水还是很有道理的，可酌情选择。\n\n\n# 四、楼层\n\n最后说一下楼层选择，一般来说，一楼和顶楼不建议选。\n\n一楼太潮湿，容易有鼠虫。若是带花园，用于养老，还可以考虑；顶楼冬冷夏热，还容易开裂漏水，除非带露台或者可以改造，如果有这方面需求可以考虑。\n\n二楼会有下水管容易淤堵问题，不过二楼一般也便宜，可以在装修时进行处理。\n\n设备层不选，会有噪音等问题。\n\n扬尘区一般在十层到十一层之间，如果对空气比较敏感的人，可能这块也会要避免注意一下。\n\n然后有一些楼房外立面设计一些装饰的横梁或者柱子，这些横梁、柱子所在楼层最好也不要选，因为它会有一个遮挡，影响你的实际使用，容易造成房屋采光的问题，影响业主观赏窗外景观等情况，购买时要多沟通，最好仔细看一下相关图纸，查看合约，这样对我们才有一个更好的保障。\n\n如何挑选房子，基本上注意以上几点，就没有什么大的问题。这里也友情提示一下，根据目前我国的房地产发展趋势，及有整个行业的现状来说，从投资角度，二线城市以下的房子，可能需要特别谨慎购买，增值和变现的能力未来可能面临挑战。祝大家都能买到心仪的房子，早日上车。\n\n感谢葫芦的挑房子经验分享。\n\n其实买房是个大命题，我就说一个楼板房，那种老式的，尽量你别买，晚上楼上楼下你一个小动作，上下楼层之间的邻居都听得非常清楚，他们当作噪音。\n\n所以你根本是无法在家健身、练钢琴、打球甚至大声说话的，否则成天有人投诉你，你也会投诉对方尤其楼上，110都会被叫来，何必呢？所以，楼板很薄的那种楼板房不能买。\n\n相对来说，年轻人买期房更好，交易对方不是个人，资金更安全，新房也采用的最新建筑技术和设施，面积也大一点。你去那些老小区，连地下停车库都没有，还有没电梯的，安保设施差，谁都能进，物业费没人缴，这些就不是好房子。\n\n还有很多，但都是战术细节，不说了，最后我们来说下买房投资的势商。\n\n\n# 买房买哪里？\n\n根据我过去多年的经验和统计，首选肯定是身边上班的地方，这样省了房租。身边不好买，则买市区，保值增值。如果是投资，则开发区的大品牌新楼盘，也可以买。\n\n> 投资已不建议，抵制炒房，稳定楼市，让老百姓们都能买的起房。\n\n开发商，当然选择大型房地产巨头，他们有钱有经验，其次是本地知名开发商，他们有地方关系。其他小开发商要谨慎，不但很多问题，有些你贷款都成问题，这还仅仅是个开始。这跟我们求职挑大公司大单位是一个道理。\n\n\n\n对于投资，首选大城市北上广深杭苏，接着是长三角珠三角都市圈中的其他地级市，然后才是其他30来个省会和计划单列市，最后就是你老家。实际上投资老家就是个情怀，情怀如果还能升值，那更好。\n\n这些我已经在过去分享太多了，就叫做势商，也是本号的名称。\n\n

常州以及常州的房价\n\n当然，也不是北上广深的房价就一直涨，但是根据历史数据更展望趋势来看，欧美发到国家的大城市房价依然很贵，说明接下来几十年，我们的大城市房价也不会低，人口虹吸效应以及净流入的地方，房价自然高。\n\n某个地方大量放开落户、人才引进、说明这地方房价撑不住了，需要补充年轻人进场。\n\n但是，一线城市内部，也不是靠近人民广场、天安门或者深圳关内就一定会最贵。以上海为例，目前内环比如均价16万、中环12万、外环8万、外郊环4万，但后面郊区会吃香，且互联网经济进一步发展，减少了一线城市的作用，地价等弊端凸显。\n\n所以，大城市的市中心房价增值潜力不大了，因为大城市会空心化，产业被转移是经济趋势，改变不了。短期10年来看，人民广场附近或者上海内环现在的均价16万，当下是郊区嘉定4万的4倍，其实是虚高的，我认为最多2倍。\n\n大家拭目以待。也就是你接下来投资内环不如中环，中环不如外环，外环不如外郊环。这是根据势商来的，基于一定的数据和对未来的情势分析，做出的预判。\n\n上海北京广州深圳市中心当然房价还是很高或者最高，但它们的投资价值甚至经济价值，会远远小于我们过去所看到和认为的。\n\n我觉得都可以用日薄西山来形容了，至少内环单价是青浦、嘉定均价的4-6倍，这是不能持久的。历史、岁月、经济规律，都会将它打回2倍甚至1倍的原型。\n\n从势商的角度来讲，一个中产阶级在省会甚至地级市以上的城市，TA如果早早买了一套100平方的房子，则这套房子未来增值的部分≈此人在这个城市30年工资的总和。\n\n这个规律很吓人，但我身边已经至少1000位我认识的人，已经验证。\n\n其实这个规律还会在二三线重演，只不过你不知道而已。\n\n几年前，我就很清晰的指明了房价上涨的大致三阶段。你记下如下俩图，以上海为例的。\n\n\n\n\n\n其实你的城市只要不是太小，总是会如此：\n\n 1. 经济发展了10年，房价终于突破了1万；\n\n 2. 接着仅仅用了5年，均价1万就涨到了2万甚至万5；\n\n 3. 在你还没喘过气，以为再也不会大涨了，突然有个年份你会发现身边单价5万的楼盘已经遍地都是，而这个“高位翻番”的过程仅仅只需要3年时间。\n\n经济总要发展，然后这个城市一横一竖俩地铁线开通，再来一条三号线环形连接前面的十字形交通，这个雏形拉出来，房价就不会低于2万。\n\n这都是我们曾经经历过的历史，然后年轻人才会去关注好几轮的限购限贷限售的调控政策，但是防止不住第三步的高位翻番。\n\n我的同龄人在当地的富裕程度，主要就是房子套数的区别，因为一套增值的部分大致就等于一个人一辈子的工资总和，你有几个人生呢？别人十套房。\n\n以上虽然有些荒谬，但这是国内现实，甚至几十年内还会如此。我希望我的群友和读者不要贫困，至少早点买第一套房吧，我不是炒房，完全出于对你打工赚工资不易的同情。',normalizedContent:'# 前言\n\n人生中很多事情，是有很大的内在难度和挑战的，所以在这时候不要过度高估自己的能耐。很多时候自己摸索，是非常不容易的，古代的太子、靖王、景王，资源那么丰富，都需要军师。说明靠着自己“冥思苦想”，是没有结果的，等同于“闭门造车"。这点上，男孩和男性最容易被传统思维误导，他们被书本教条和名人传记中的榜样力量所激励，碰到问题时喜欢自己一个去想方法,这就是成功学教育对人长期的荼毒的结果。\n\n其实“想方法”，大概率就等于个屁，只能想出不切实际的馊主意，最终自己倒逼自己，“拼一把”，从而坚持到底就是失败，这个人生就再也没能爬得起来。\n\n这其中的破解之道其实就是正确的应用唯物辩证法，破除形而上认知的误导。\n\n其实道理是非常简单的，你在某一个困难面前踌躇不前，无非就是a不做选择、b c d三个选择。你的问题是你只知道从bc两个选项中二者必居其一，但你不知道还有个c选项，且你没有想过维持现状即a也是一种选择。\n\n对你最大的挑战还不是“选哪个”，而是选择a、b、c、d中某一个方案后，第二天会各自有什么不同，以及接下来的结果是什么样子，当初a、b、c、d对应的一个月后会产生的结果a1、b1...... ,一年后的状态a2、b2、......又是样子，接着3年5年甚至10年后，a3 b3 c3.....，又是什么样子。\n\n总之，类似4个选择，对应未来比如36种结果，你现在的势商只能想到选b还是选c，其他38个你一无所知，面对38/40也就是95%的未知，你当然想不出来确信的、有用的、未来不后悔的方案。这也是那么多人说"要是早几年认识幽哥，我怎么怎么样""就不会像现在这么发展""就不会像现在这么低薪""就不是现在这个老公/老婆"的原因。\n\n你现在感慨的所谓醍醐灌顶、相见恨晚，只是当初你不知道自己有更多的选择，也不知道该选哪一个，这才是势商的作用。光有智商、情商还没用，你球技再好、避开了狡猾的对手、一路狂飙，但你将球踢进了自家的球门，这叫自摆乌龙，算-1分。\n\n在这篇《男女求职思维的不同点》中，我们可以知晓男女追求答案的异同点。用到东北深圳美女小雨这里，我如果接受指导你，就类似将你走十年弯路才能体验出来的心得，浓缩成3-6个月提前告诉你，我这样的师长所起的作用，则是节约你九年半的青春。\n\n大家看下小雨自己求职2年的时候，下图，尽管也是在职寻求跳槽机会，但没跳得动，连面试电话都寥寥。其实这第一步可以通过简单方法就可以实现，你看《为何投简历后一个面试电话也没有？好不容易来了个垃圾公司的邀请，还紧张得要死！》。\n\n差不多在4个月后，她已经从3-4个年薪50万上下的offer当中，选择一个跳过去上班大半个月了。此时，某天上午她继续通过了一家500强外企的终试，且下午还有一家央企的面试，而这两家她的开价自然是60-80万。 细节方面，当然不是我教她试用期继续投递简历的，而是之前投出去的简历继续发挥了作用。\n\n这样一个从996不断加班的工作制下，短期3-5个月内年薪翻倍去新单位上班的过程，就是对以资本论为实质内核框架的现代社会的反向利用。\n\n\n# 正文\n\n说了这么多，才回归今天要说的主题，也就是主业提升之外的第二类报喜，生涯发展类的好消息。\n\n这中同际了副业收入之外，报吾最多的就是厉产，类似如下的消息，我几乎每周都会收到。\n\n我不知道他、她有没有告诉父母说背后有个幽哥的作用，估计跟年薪翻倍跳槽的人类似，大多数没说。\n\n\n\n具体这位学弟王兵从湖南毕业，也才本科毕业一年多，在杭州工作。\n\n如下你看下他目前的工资。他这是进群早，大三就进了群，反复被我的思维耳濡目染，这才有这样的悟性。\n\n\n\n我们说“到底如何买房？\n\n这跟“到底如何工作？”是一样的。\n\n你的工作，第一要务是学会获得工作的能力，无论进体制内还是体制外，你先要明白进入的方法；其次，是追求同样成本付出下最高的工资和最大的收益，其实就是学会谈工资、倒逼法；第三，才是之前你认为最重要的具体某个岗位上的工作技能。\n\n你在老家月薪两三千时拿着一份英文报纸背某个单词，你是无法实现去外企500强获得高薪、发展职业的。用战术上的勤劳和外表的自欺人，来弥补战略上你的无知和懒惰，这是绝大多数人贫困一生的原因。\n\n我们买房也是如此，你最要花功夫的不是去看房子门朝南还是朝北、精装修还是毛坯、周围有没有超市……这些是第三步的战术，你别本末倒置。\n\n\n# 第一步：买不买房\n\n买房第一步，叫做买不买房。\n\n“买”这个字是核心，是最大的战略。\n\n学弟王兵2019年6月毕业时根据我的经验海投去了杭州，年薪十万。他毕业前就看了我的文章，比如这篇《第一套房，首付款一般是怎么来的？》，心中已经有数，他知道首付款靠工资显然是来不及积累的。\n\n继续，在他毕业大半年时，准确的说是2020年4 月，看了这篇《女孩买婚前第一套房，如何向亲戚借钱才能提高成功概率？》。此时他杭州没有买房资格，但他已经准备尽早买房，他完成了第一步“准备买”的问题。我当时这篇教大家如何凑首付，解决了"怎么买"中最难的钱的问题。\n\n他毕业半年多，也就余下了勉强5万，但是80万的房子首付需要25万，无非就是问亲友、叔叔阿姨、同学同事等海借个20万，这不是难事。\n\n为何不选择杭州？这就是买房第二步需要解决的问题。2017年我的文章《南通会不会并入上海？（看完，少走20年弯路）》早就为他避免了弯路，给了他这方面的势商。\n\n就拿买房目的地来说，可以归纳出王兵自己此时的三座城市优先排序：一买身边的一线城市上海的房子，二所在的发达二线城市杭州，三老家省会长沙。\n\n很明显，上海他没购房资格，钱也完全不够；杭州还需要一年多才有资格买，且房款也不够，总价都300万的；本科毕业一年能买的当然是家乡所在的省会长沙。\n\n\n# 第二步：买哪里\n\n于是凑到了25万，首付长沙房子在我这篇“海借”文章出炉后的第二个月2020年5月，成为了现实。这步解决的是买房的第二个问题，“买哪里”。\n\n至于买长沙房子时买哪个小区、靠不靠近地铁站、买新房还是二手房等等，那就是他个人要去花心思去尝试和选择的小问题了。前两步战略我这个幽哥算买房师父，已经给你指明了方向和方法。\n\n当然，还有个买房的时机问题，在去年的2月1号，我甚至都指出了最近几年有个房价低点，就是疫情出现到2020年下半年之间。去年我都写了五六篇文章来提及这个判断了，最早的你看2月的《疫情后，职场人的机遇与挑战》，3月的《谈下疫情下的房产以及购房心得》，小截图如下。\n\n\n\n我写得很明确，武汉被疫情影响较深，房价的低点在2020年的10-12月，其他地方尤其一二三线城市，低点则是在2020年的4-9月。\n\n包括《2020到2022，甚至2025年前的经济增长率如何？房价会如何发展？》《春节后看下房价》等文章，我甚至在2020年9月底，模拟出来了未来1年到5年的经济增长率、房价在疫情后的这波上涨启动时间、什么时候结束，等等。这些就是势商。\n\n以上给出了买房时机的建议，具体群友王兵们，就是赶在2020年的5月到12月之间买了房的，这叫抓住了这次势商。\n\n大家注意下，无论是你的职业人生还是副业与买房，我幽哥解决的叫战略，影响你的一生，但是大量的人却是来问：“幽哥，我简历上这句如何措辞？”“领导刚刚这句话是什么意思？”“买长沙哪个新盘""精装修能不能买？"…\n\n你这是对我的战略作用视而不见，且将我大材小用了。另外，我哪有时间给你分析武汉、长沙还是天津的某套房子，我的职场徒弟和那个2万元咨询费的生活伙伴，指导也没这么细。\n\n\n# 第三步：如何挑房\n\n当然，买房第三步是"如何挑房？"这步也不是不重要，只不过这只是战术。\n\n接下来，分享下房产行业资深群友葫芦的挑房子心得，这是"到底如何买房"的第三部分。\n\n> 标题：如何选房子？\n> \n> 作者：葫芦\n\n对于许多人来说，买房都是人生中的大事，也是投资理财、资产保值的一个重要手段，甚至是解决户口及居住问题的一个必要方法。那么，如何挑选合适的房子呢？本身葫芦在房地产也有10年的行业经验，然后自己也有过几次买房经验，现在分享给大家。\n\n\n# 一、地段\n\n买房子最重要的首先就是地段。大家都知道一个商品一旦出售，它本身是不断在贬值的，但是我们会发现一个奇怪的现象，无论房产无论新旧，它都是不断的升值的，这是为什么呢？实际上本质原因是，因为地价在不断的上涨，房价增值的部分其实就是土地的溢价值。\n\n所以，房产价值的核心就是地段。这里也特别说明一点，就目前整个房地产市场行情，越是优质的地段，就越是优质的资产。那么在未来抗风险的能力就会越强，因此，也推荐大家尽量选择地段好的房子。\n\n地段好的房子，有几个核心的要素：学区、商圈、交通、医院配套等。\n\n# 1. 学区\n\n我国自古重视教育，为孩子教育不惜代价，古有“孟母三迁”，今有“学区房”。学区房是未来升值潜力、抗风险能力最强的房产之一。\n\n但是，不同的地区教育制度也在改革，入学政策时有变化。所以，购买学区房的时候，要重点关注区域教育部门的入学政策。\n\n比如，有的地区是小学按学区划分，然后中学摇号的话，那就是只有小学学区。有的地区则是，初中阶段按学区片区入学了，那么便初中的学区。如果有小学和初中都带的学区则更好。现在各地的入学政策各有不同，也在不断变化之中，所以购买学区房，重点关注地区所属的政策，直接影响学区房的价值。\n\n# 2. 商圈\n\n商圈这一块，有购物中心、商圈，生活便利，地段繁华也是好地段的特征之一。还有特别好的企业或机关单位的附近的小区，也是高潜力增长地区。因为未来在这工作的人普遍高收入，较高的社会地位，直接会拉动这个区域发展。\n\n比如说，曾经有开发商专门在北京的互联网大厂附近建小区，项目房价不断翻番，甚至创建了该开发商高端系房产产品，为其后来布局全国打下基础。这可是成就了一个企业，更别说个人了。\n\n# 3. 交通\n\n出行这块，交通便利程度也很关键。上下班是否方便，离公司多远，地铁口、公交车站是否直达，距离高铁站、机场的距离等，决定了以后你未来生活出行方便，是生活便利程度的重要参考。而且一般来说交通便利的地方，小区的位置一般都不错。\n\n# 4. 医院\n\n这里重点说下医院，看病、体检方便，毕竟健康很重要。好的三甲医院附近，未来都是紧俏资源。尤其是我国未来老龄化人口不断激增，这块需求会不断增加。\n\n特别是有实力的富裕阶层，到达一定年龄后，为了自己的身体健康和方便，会优先考虑医院附近的优质房产。有较高的购买能力，同时也是一种健康生存需求，这块的资产的溢价值也会比较高。\n\n\n# 二、楼栋位置\n\n根据地段选定区域项目后，就是项目楼栋挑选问题。一般最好不要买临街和带底商的楼栋。靠近路边有噪音，比较吵，灰尘也大，空气质量差。底层有商业还容易有装修纠纷、油烟污染、人员杂不安全等问题。\n\n一般来说，小区楼栋越靠近中心景观的位置，楼栋价钱会越高，如果排除不选街边的话，那么就根据自己的购买能力，在小区内部选择合适的就好了。\n\n\n# 三、户型\n\n选择户型，先根据实际需要，选择合适的户型大小。然后，朝向上尽量选坐北朝南，这样无论是日照、风向都比较理想，满足冬暖夏凉的要求。朝北就完全反过来了，最好不选。\n\n户型选择上，尽量要选择方正的户型。现在流行一些奇葩的设计，然后导致户型缺角或者不规则形状的房间，这种实际上是非常不好用，风水寓意也不佳。从设计和空间利用的角度来说，户型越方正，空间的利用率就会越高，得房率也会越高。\n\n经历过的项目，比如八十多米平户型，如果是户型方正和布局合理的话，高层双电梯，房屋公摊系数可以控制在10%~12%，这样的比例是非常可观的，光套内的面积就达到七十多个平方米。\n\n整个的房间及布局会很好用，这样的房子在未来的二手房出手时也会更好卖，好议价。方正的户型，装修上成本也会更节约，室内设计空间动线更有选择性，也方便拓展改建。要是讲究些，用于自住的话，也可以请合适的风水先生来帮看一下，做些专业的咨询，风水还是很有道理的，可酌情选择。\n\n\n# 四、楼层\n\n最后说一下楼层选择，一般来说，一楼和顶楼不建议选。\n\n一楼太潮湿，容易有鼠虫。若是带花园，用于养老，还可以考虑；顶楼冬冷夏热，还容易开裂漏水，除非带露台或者可以改造，如果有这方面需求可以考虑。\n\n二楼会有下水管容易淤堵问题，不过二楼一般也便宜，可以在装修时进行处理。\n\n设备层不选，会有噪音等问题。\n\n扬尘区一般在十层到十一层之间，如果对空气比较敏感的人，可能这块也会要避免注意一下。\n\n然后有一些楼房外立面设计一些装饰的横梁或者柱子，这些横梁、柱子所在楼层最好也不要选，因为它会有一个遮挡，影响你的实际使用，容易造成房屋采光的问题，影响业主观赏窗外景观等情况，购买时要多沟通，最好仔细看一下相关图纸，查看合约，这样对我们才有一个更好的保障。\n\n如何挑选房子，基本上注意以上几点，就没有什么大的问题。这里也友情提示一下，根据目前我国的房地产发展趋势，及有整个行业的现状来说，从投资角度，二线城市以下的房子，可能需要特别谨慎购买，增值和变现的能力未来可能面临挑战。祝大家都能买到心仪的房子，早日上车。\n\n感谢葫芦的挑房子经验分享。\n\n其实买房是个大命题，我就说一个楼板房，那种老式的，尽量你别买，晚上楼上楼下你一个小动作，上下楼层之间的邻居都听得非常清楚，他们当作噪音。\n\n所以你根本是无法在家健身、练钢琴、打球甚至大声说话的，否则成天有人投诉你，你也会投诉对方尤其楼上，110都会被叫来，何必呢？所以，楼板很薄的那种楼板房不能买。\n\n相对来说，年轻人买期房更好，交易对方不是个人，资金更安全，新房也采用的最新建筑技术和设施，面积也大一点。你去那些老小区，连地下停车库都没有，还有没电梯的，安保设施差，谁都能进，物业费没人缴，这些就不是好房子。\n\n还有很多，但都是战术细节，不说了，最后我们来说下买房投资的势商。\n\n\n# 买房买哪里？\n\n根据我过去多年的经验和统计，首选肯定是身边上班的地方，这样省了房租。身边不好买，则买市区，保值增值。如果是投资，则开发区的大品牌新楼盘，也可以买。\n\n> 投资已不建议，抵制炒房，稳定楼市，让老百姓们都能买的起房。\n\n开发商，当然选择大型房地产巨头，他们有钱有经验，其次是本地知名开发商，他们有地方关系。其他小开发商要谨慎，不但很多问题，有些你贷款都成问题，这还仅仅是个开始。这跟我们求职挑大公司大单位是一个道理。\n\n\n\n对于投资，首选大城市北上广深杭苏，接着是长三角珠三角都市圈中的其他地级市，然后才是其他30来个省会和计划单列市，最后就是你老家。实际上投资老家就是个情怀，情怀如果还能升值，那更好。\n\n这些我已经在过去分享太多了，就叫做势商，也是本号的名称。\n\n

常州以及常州的房价\n\n当然，也不是北上广深的房价就一直涨，但是根据历史数据更展望趋势来看，欧美发到国家的大城市房价依然很贵，说明接下来几十年，我们的大城市房价也不会低，人口虹吸效应以及净流入的地方，房价自然高。\n\n某个地方大量放开落户、人才引进、说明这地方房价撑不住了，需要补充年轻人进场。\n\n但是，一线城市内部，也不是靠近人民广场、天安门或者深圳关内就一定会最贵。以上海为例，目前内环比如均价16万、中环12万、外环8万、外郊环4万，但后面郊区会吃香，且互联网经济进一步发展，减少了一线城市的作用，地价等弊端凸显。\n\n所以，大城市的市中心房价增值潜力不大了，因为大城市会空心化，产业被转移是经济趋势，改变不了。短期10年来看，人民广场附近或者上海内环现在的均价16万，当下是郊区嘉定4万的4倍，其实是虚高的，我认为最多2倍。\n\n大家拭目以待。也就是你接下来投资内环不如中环，中环不如外环，外环不如外郊环。这是根据势商来的，基于一定的数据和对未来的情势分析，做出的预判。\n\n上海北京广州深圳市中心当然房价还是很高或者最高，但它们的投资价值甚至经济价值，会远远小于我们过去所看到和认为的。\n\n我觉得都可以用日薄西山来形容了，至少内环单价是青浦、嘉定均价的4-6倍，这是不能持久的。历史、岁月、经济规律，都会将它打回2倍甚至1倍的原型。\n\n从势商的角度来讲，一个中产阶级在省会甚至地级市以上的城市，ta如果早早买了一套100平方的房子，则这套房子未来增值的部分≈此人在这个城市30年工资的总和。\n\n这个规律很吓人，但我身边已经至少1000位我认识的人，已经验证。\n\n其实这个规律还会在二三线重演，只不过你不知道而已。\n\n几年前，我就很清晰的指明了房价上涨的大致三阶段。你记下如下俩图，以上海为例的。\n\n\n\n\n\n其实你的城市只要不是太小，总是会如此：\n\n 1. 经济发展了10年，房价终于突破了1万；\n\n 2. 接着仅仅用了5年，均价1万就涨到了2万甚至万5；\n\n 3. 在你还没喘过气，以为再也不会大涨了，突然有个年份你会发现身边单价5万的楼盘已经遍地都是，而这个“高位翻番”的过程仅仅只需要3年时间。\n\n经济总要发展，然后这个城市一横一竖俩地铁线开通，再来一条三号线环形连接前面的十字形交通，这个雏形拉出来，房价就不会低于2万。\n\n这都是我们曾经经历过的历史，然后年轻人才会去关注好几轮的限购限贷限售的调控政策，但是防止不住第三步的高位翻番。\n\n我的同龄人在当地的富裕程度，主要就是房子套数的区别，因为一套增值的部分大致就等于一个人一辈子的工资总和，你有几个人生呢？别人十套房。\n\n以上虽然有些荒谬，但这是国内现实，甚至几十年内还会如此。我希望我的群友和读者不要贫困，至少早点买第一套房吧，我不是炒房，完全出于对你打工赚工资不易的同情。',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2023/04/19

picgo是一款开源的图片上传软件，专门负责连通客户与其存储图片的服务器，不过可惜的是picgo的稳定性并不是很强，配置过程中也有很多坑和奇怪的错误，这篇文章分享一下我的配置经验，给想要配的人一个参考。\n\n> 结合这篇文章，完整的配置流程一般1个小时可以配置完成。\n\n警告\n\n20230212：不知道因为什么原因，防火墙似乎有变动，会导致PICGO的日志中显示Git和PicGo等软件无法链接GitHub，造成各种因为链接不通畅而产生的错误，解决方法如下：\n\n 1. 访问IPaddress查询ip\n\n 2. 把140.82.112.4 github.com字段添加进电脑的Host文件，即可正常使用\n\n首先安装软件，软件下载地址，下载后直接安装即可，没有需要特别注意的点，默认路径即可。\n\n> 教程PICGO版本：2.4.0 beta6\n\n\n\n# 配置教程\n\n\n# 预准备\n\n安装完软件后建议先先安装picgo-plugin-github-plus插件\n\n> 这个插件非常好用，可以实现双向同步GitHub仓库的图片，而软件自带的GITHUB的只能存图不能删图，删除图片流程会很麻烦。\n\n安装方法:\n\n 1. 在软件界面左边点击插件设置，并在搜索框搜索github\n\n 2. 使用git bash客户端输入npm代码安装，npm的来源根据自己网络情况而定\n\nnpm install --location=global picgo-plugin-github-plus\n#为了实现全局安装，最新版的npm已经不推荐使用-g或-global了，建议使用--location=global。\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n安装完成后即可在picgo里找到github plus插件\n\n如果没有显示，则在picgo设置里找到并勾选,就会显示在图床设置中了\n\n\n\n# 图床配置\n\n点开图床设置，可以看到依次有六个选项\n\n\n\n\n\n# Repo\n\nrepo是repository的缩写也就是仓库路径,首先是要去GitHub建立一个仓库\n\n记得一定要选择public选项, 不然没法使用里面的图片\n\n> (所以这意味着所有图片别人都可以从你的仓库访问, 一定要注意上传的图片的脱敏性, 预防隐私泄露)\n\n\n\n新建好仓库后repo这一栏填写 "你的Github Id"/"仓库名" 即可\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Branch\n\n注意:这里再2020年之后就必须填成main, 因为GitHub把默认分支名字改了(因为master这个名字被网友喷了，说有种族歧视的意味)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Token\n\n这个是重点，目的是让PICGO能与Github完成信息确认与身份验证，避免其他人在得知你的仓库地址后乱传东西进取。操作方法如下：\n\n 1. 到GitHub设置里，点击头像找到setting\n\n 2. 左侧往下找到开发者设置\n\n 3. 自己新建一个token密钥\n\n\n\n\n\n几个关键的注意点：\n\n 1. 名字随便取，但尽量可以让自己以后看到了也知道这个token是干什么用的\n 2. 如果没有特殊要求，有效期选择无限时长即可\n 3. 下方需要勾选token的权限范围。picgo只需要勾选repo相关选项即可\n 4. 完成选项的填写与勾选后，点击该页面最下方generate token即可生成\n 5. 生成的TOKEN代码只会在本次的页面显示，刷新页面、重新加载后就会永久隐藏。也是为了保障token的安全，所以最好备份好(可在配置好的图床json文件中找到，详细路径请看文末), 否则只能再建一个token\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Path\n\n这个是存照片的路径，是用来指定仓库中的存储路径的，这里有个报错天坑，网上没什么人提到，就是一定要事前通过Git把要的文件夹创建好，否则软件识别不到路径就报错了，(且文件夹还不能是空的, GitHub空文件夹=不存在,赛个txt也好)，因此如果嫌麻烦可以空着，这样所有的照片都会出现在仓库的根目录，其实也不影响使用。\n\n具体教程参考这篇文章Git版本管理软件使用心得 -

在窗口中可直接点击按钮打开，此事会弹出一个记事本文件，里面会用时间戳的形式一行一行详细的记录软件各种操作执行的情况，如果报错，也会提示具体的报错代码。在报错的情况下，可以尝试把对应时间戳的信息复制到百度中查询，如果是特定时间段内统一出现的问题，那网上大概率可以找到很多问题解决的帖子，而且根据经验，绝大多数问题都是网络问题导致的。\n 3. 新版本的picgo增加了上传提示的系统提醒，可以开着这个，这样报错了可能会有相应弹窗。\n\n\n\n\n\n',normalizedContent:'# 前言\n\n2022.04.05更新 picgo是一款开源的图片上传软件，专门负责连通客户与其存储图片的服务器，不过可惜的是picgo的稳定性并不是很强，配置过程中也有很多坑和奇怪的错误，这篇文章分享一下我的配置经验，给想要配的人一个参考。\n\n> 结合这篇文章，完整的配置流程一般1个小时可以配置完成。\n\n警告\n\n20230212：不知道因为什么原因，防火墙似乎有变动，会导致picgo的日志中显示git和picgo等软件无法链接github，造成各种因为链接不通畅而产生的错误，解决方法如下：\n\n 1. 访问ipaddress查询ip\n\n 2. 把140.82.112.4 github.com字段添加进电脑的host文件，即可正常使用\n\n首先安装软件，软件下载地址，下载后直接安装即可，没有需要特别注意的点，默认路径即可。\n\n> 教程picgo版本：2.4.0 beta6\n\n\n\n# 配置教程\n\n\n# 预准备\n\n安装完软件后建议先先安装picgo-plugin-github-plus插件\n\n> 这个插件非常好用，可以实现双向同步github仓库的图片，而软件自带的github的只能存图不能删图，删除图片流程会很麻烦。\n\n安装方法:\n\n 1. 在软件界面左边点击插件设置，并在搜索框搜索github\n\n 2. 使用git bash客户端输入npm代码安装，npm的来源根据自己网络情况而定\n\nnpm install --location=global picgo-plugin-github-plus\n#为了实现全局安装，最新版的npm已经不推荐使用-g或-global了，建议使用--location=global。\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n安装完成后即可在picgo里找到github plus插件\n\n如果没有显示，则在picgo设置里找到并勾选,就会显示在图床设置中了\n\n\n\n# 图床配置\n\n点开图床设置，可以看到依次有六个选项\n\n\n\n\n\n# repo\n\nrepo是repository的缩写也就是仓库路径,首先是要去github建立一个仓库\n\n记得一定要选择public选项, 不然没法使用里面的图片\n\n> (所以这意味着所有图片别人都可以从你的仓库访问, 一定要注意上传的图片的脱敏性, 预防隐私泄露)\n\n\n\n新建好仓库后repo这一栏填写 "你的github id"/"仓库名" 即可\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# branch\n\n注意:这里再2020年之后就必须填成main, 因为github把默认分支名字改了(因为master这个名字被网友喷了，说有种族歧视的意味)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# token\n\n这个是重点，目的是让picgo能与github完成信息确认与身份验证，避免其他人在得知你的仓库地址后乱传东西进取。操作方法如下：\n\n 1. 到github设置里，点击头像找到setting\n\n 2. 左侧往下找到开发者设置\n\n 3. 自己新建一个token密钥\n\n\n\n\n\n几个关键的注意点：\n\n 1. 名字随便取，但尽量可以让自己以后看到了也知道这个token是干什么用的\n 2. 如果没有特殊要求，有效期选择无限时长即可\n 3. 下方需要勾选token的权限范围。picgo只需要勾选repo相关选项即可\n 4. 完成选项的填写与勾选后，点击该页面最下方generate token即可生成\n 5. 生成的token代码只会在本次的页面显示，刷新页面、重新加载后就会永久隐藏。也是为了保障token的安全，所以最好备份好(可在配置好的图床json文件中找到，详细路径请看文末), 否则只能再建一个token\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# path\n\n这个是存照片的路径，是用来指定仓库中的存储路径的，这里有个报错天坑，网上没什么人提到，就是一定要事前通过git把要的文件夹创建好，否则软件识别不到路径就报错了，(且文件夹还不能是空的, github空文件夹=不存在,赛个txt也好)，因此如果嫌麻烦可以空着，这样所有的照片都会出现在仓库的根目录，其实也不影响使用。\n\n具体教程参考这篇文章git版本管理软件使用心得 - tommy\'s blog (tommyzeng.com)\n\n当建好后img文件夹后, 就可以写上,这样才能上传成功,否则一直报错,picgo没权限建文件夹\n\n> 反正原版github插件不可以，这个plus插件理论上权限更多，还没测试这样会不会报错，反正多做一步省得报错\n\nimg/\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#

第一部分：基础操作介绍\n\n场景：克隆Github上的仓库内容并进行基本的文件操作(读、写、修改等)\n\n先讲讲克隆的效果, 执行完git的命令后, 会下载仓库内容至本地，并存放在一个与仓库同名的文件夹内, 并可进行更多操作\n\n提示\n\n如果仓库叫TommyZeng/picgo, 文件夹名字就会叫picgo\n\n> 建议找一个文件比较多的仓库fork(转存)到自己的GitHub中, 来练习基础的增删查改\n\n\n# 1. 首先是执行克隆指令\n\n警告\n\n注意仓库链接在这里\n\ngit clone + "仓库链接"\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n# 2. 执行初始化指令, 生成与仓库的通讯链接\n\n注意\n\n这个步骤在已经建好GitHub仓库的情况下并没有必要, 是在GitHub上没有建仓时让用户可直接在本地建仓的一种办法\n\ngit init

# 配置邮件\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 3. 增删查改的方法\n\n通常完成上一步后, 就会下载到相当多的文件夹\n\n删除文件的方法：\n\n> 大多数文档里的方法是用下面这个代码一个个删除，说实话动的文件多了NM就离谱\n\ngit rm "文件名"\t        #删除文件\ngit rm -r "文件夹名字"  #删除文件夹\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 批量删除/新建文件后同步至仓库\n\n我们主要讲怎么批量删除/新建文件\n\n步骤\n\n第一步: 直接资源管理器(我的电脑)里删掉想要删除的文件, 或直接新建想要的文件 然后在git bash里输入git add .(注意.与add之间空一格)把改动添加到缓存 然后用git commit -m "clear"一次性全部删除\n\n> "引号里不一定要写clear, 任意字母都可以,但切记不能空着"\n\n这是不是就不用一个个文件commit确认，特省事情\n\n\n\n# 推送上传至仓库\n\n提示\n\n文件修改完后,用git push即可推送本地仓库至远程仓库即可\n\n注意\n\n网上有说第一次推送仓库的时候好像得用这行代码的, 2022/04/02测试了几个仓库,都不用执行这步,可忽略\n\ngit push -u origin main #第一次推送main分支时使用-u指令\ngit push origin main\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n做到这一步会不会对这个图理解更深了?\n\nworkspace: 本地工作区 staging area: 缓存区/暂存区 local

GitHub在2020年把主分支从默认的main改成了main\n\n完成后即可按上面的增删步骤管理仓库内容\n\n\n# 避坑\n\n网上很多帖子会查出各种命令如\n\ngit add -A . #这个实测没啥用" ."就可以了\n\n递归删除法(删除全部文件)\ngit rm xxx                                                # 删除index中的文件\ngit rm -r *   # 递归删除文件(可全删)      \n\ngit commit -m \'add more files\'一次提交所有文件\n\ngit status \t#告知你文件情况\ngit commit -m \'first commit\'\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n这些命令基本都能用, 不过有些杂乱,且让人晕头转向, 不用太在意这些\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第二部分：Git连接Github\n\n两者通信依赖SSH或者HTTP进行连接，SSH是电脑长期连接拉去数据时最方便的方案，操作流程如下：\n\n\n# 一、 生成 SSH 密钥\n\n# 1. 打开终端\n\n * 在 Mac 或 Linux 上，你可以直接打开 Terminal 应用程序。\n * 在 Windows 上，你可以使用 PowerShell 或者如果安装了 Git，可以使用 Git Bash。\n\n# 2. 运行 SSH 密钥生成命令\n\n * 在终端中，输入以下命令来生成一个新的 SSH 密钥：\n   \n   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   * ssh-keygen 是用于生成 SSH 密钥的命令。\n   * -t rsa 指定密钥类型为 RSA，这是一种常用的密钥算法。\n   * -b 4096 指定密钥长度为 4096 位，这比默认的 2048 位更安全。\n   * -C 后面跟的是一个注释，通常是你的邮箱地址，用于帮助你识别这个密钥。这个邮箱应该是你的 GitHub 注册邮箱。\n\n# 3. 指定密钥保存位置\n\n * 当运行上述命令后，系统会询问你保存密钥的位置。如果你接受默认位置（通常是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa），直接按回车即可。如果你已经有了一个 SSH 密钥，系统会提示你是否要覆盖它。如果不想覆盖，可以输入一个新的文件名。\n\n# 4. 设置密钥密码\n\n * 接下来，系统会提示你输入一个密码（passphrase）。这是一个可选步骤，但为了增加安全性，建议设置一个密码。\n * 这个密码每次使用这个密钥时都会被要求输入，可以防止未经授权的用户使用你的密钥。\n * 输入密码后，系统会要求你再次确认。\n\n完成这些步骤后，你的新电脑上就会生成一个新的 SSH 密钥对。接下来，你需要将生成的公钥（.pub 文件）添加到你的 GitHub 账户中，这样 GitHub 就可以识别并信任从你的新电脑发出的 SSH 连接请求了。\n\n> 在 SSH 密钥生成过程中，当系统提示你输入密钥密码（passphrase）时，你可能注意到在输入时看不到任何反馈（例如星号或点），这是正常的。SSH 密钥生成工具为了安全考虑，不会在终端显示密码字符。即使你看不到输入的内容，你的输入是有效的。以下是这一步骤的详细说明：\n> \n> \n> # 输入 SSH 密钥密码\n> \n>  1. 输入密码时无可视反馈：\n>     \n>     * 当系统提示你输入密码时，即使你在键盘上输入，终端也不会显示任何字符。这是为了防止旁观者看到密码长度或模式。\n>     * 正常输入你的密码即可，即使看不到任何字符变化。\n> \n>  2. 确认密码：\n>     \n>     * 输入完密码后，按下回车键。然后，系统会要求你再次输入密码以进行确认。\n>     * 同样，在输入确认密码时，你也不会在终端看到任何可视反馈。\n>     * 再次输入相同的密码，并按回车键。\n> \n>  3. 完成密钥生成：\n>     \n>     * 如果两次输入的密码相同，系统就会生成 SSH 密钥，并保存到指定的文件中。\n>     * 你会看到一条消息，确认你的公钥和私钥的保存位置，以及一个随机生成的图案，表示你的密钥的指纹。\n> \n> \n> # 后续步骤\n> \n>  * 检查密钥：完成密钥生成后，你可以在指定的目录（通常是 ~/.ssh）下找到两个文件：一个是私钥（例如 id_rsa），另一个是公钥（例如 id_rsa.pub）。\n>  * 添加公钥到 GitHub：将公钥（.pub 文件的内容）添加到你的 GitHub 账户中，以便 GitHub 可以识别你的新设备。\n> \n> 记住，私钥是非常敏感的，必须保持安全，不要分享或发送给任何人。公钥是可以安全分享的部分，用于在服务如 GitHub 上进行身份验证。\n\n\n\n# 二、复制 SSH 公钥\n\n首先，你需要复制你刚生成的 SSH 公钥（.pub 文件）的内容。假设你使用的是默认的文件名和位置，你的公钥文件将是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub。你可以使用下面的命令来快速复制公钥内容到剪贴板：\n\n * 在 macOS 或 Linux 上：\n   \n   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   \n   （如果 pbcopy 不可用，你可以手动打开该文件并复制内容）\n\n * 在 Windows 上使用 Git Bash：\n   \n   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   \n\n\n# 三、添加 SSH 公钥到 GitHub\n\n然后，将复制的公钥添加到你的 GitHub 账户：\n\n 1. 登录到你的 GitHub 账户。\n 2. 打开设置：点击右上角的头像，然后选择“Settings”（设置）。\n 3. 添加 SSH 密钥：\n    * 在设置页面的侧边栏中，点击“SSH and GPG keys”。\n    * 点击“New SSH key”或“Add SSH key”按钮。\n    * 在“Title”字段中，给你的密钥一个容易识别的名称。这个名称是为了帮助你以后记住这个密钥是用在哪台电脑上的。\n    * 在“Key”字段中，粘贴你之前复制的公钥。\n    * 点击“Add SSH key”来保存新的密钥。\n\n\n\n# 四、 测试 SSH 连接\n\n完成公钥添加后，测试一下是否能够通过 SSH 连接到 GitHub：\n\n * 打开终端或 Git Bash。\n * 输入以下命令：\n   \n   ssh -T git@github.com\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n * 如果是第一次连接 GitHub，可能会看到一个关于服务器身份的警告。输入 yes 继续。\n * 如果一切设置正确，你将看到一条欢迎信息，如：“Hi [username]! You\'ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.”\n\n这个欢迎信息表示 SSH 设置正确，并且你已经成功地通过 SSH 连接到了 GitHub。\n\n\n\n# 五、开始使用 SSH 进行 Git 操作\n\n一旦 SSH 设置完成，你就可以开始使用 SSH 进行 Git 操作了，例如克隆、推送或拉取仓库。使用 SSH URL 而不是 HTTPS URL 来克隆或操作你的仓库。\n\n例如，克隆仓库的命令将类似于：\n\ngit clone git@github.com:username/repo.git\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n这些步骤确保了你可以安全地通过 SSH 与你的 GitHub 仓库交互。\n\n\n\n# 常见问题解决\n\n# 无法连接服务的解决方法\n\n这部分如果是长期连接会用到SSH，这里有个坑是git的代理设置不对导致没有走上网的端口导致连不上，对应的报错代码如下：\n\nFailed to connect to github.com port 443 after 21111 ms: Couldn\'t connect to server\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n如出现类似问题，可以试着用以下的代码，大概率可以解决。\n\ngit config --global http.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890\ngit config --global https.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 实战操作案例——Git分支推送历史功能\n\n更新出现异常解决办法\n\n因为很喜欢给博客添加新功能，但又很容易出现不明bug，应该充分利用Git的定档备份功能，出现问题后及时回滚\n\n显示分支提交命令，会显示出提交历史，和提交代码\n\ngit log  #退出按Q即可\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n研究git checkout和git reset的区别，以及两者在操作上的区别\n\n\n# 实战操作方法\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况一：修改提交了commit且push\n\n方法一：\n\ngit reset --hard HEAD^ #一个^代表一个版本，倒退^^两个版本，~100=回退100个版本\ngit reset --hard id #回退到指定的id码\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n> 这个方法不推荐，因为会直接覆盖掉回退前的记录。(虽然不是真的删了)\n> \n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 直接变成 1 –> 2\n\n这个时候再PUSH会提示线上版本比线下版本新，所以的强制提交\n\ngit push -f #强制提交\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n方法二：\n\ngit revert commit_id #用log里的版本号完全替代掉commit_id这几个字符\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该命令意思是撤销，但保留提交记录\n\n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 变成 1 –> 2 --\x3e 3 –>4 将回退到2但以2作为主体新建新的4号commit\n> \n> 注意： 操作中commit_id应写需要被移除的版本号，而上面reset则是输入要去到的版本号\n\n输入完成后会进入和git commit --amend一样的界面，用I进入输入模式，在revert “”的冒号里输入更新的名称，输入:wq回车退出。\n\nrevert命令可以直接push，不需要担心push不上去，因为是新建的commit，不会出现线上版本比线下版本好的报错。\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况二：修改并提交了，但没有push\n\n 1. git reset --soft #撤销commit\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. git reset --mixed 撤销commit和add两个动作\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n> 以上两个办法都不会真正删除文件，Git中依旧可以查找出并还原，方便在各个版本间穿梭\n\n查看完整提交历史\n\ngit reflog \n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n# 0924分支推送记录\n\n当天由于更新出了bug，需要回滚到之前的版本，出现了很多问题，最核心的问题是\n\n * 回滚后无法提交git push。\n\n * 回退版本的reset和revert指令都不好用\n\n * git commit --amend指令很难用（其实是看错了操作方法）\n\n# Git操作收获——commit --amend\n\ngit commit --amend #修改提交信息（用于修改最近一次提交的提交信息）\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该模式下默认会显示很多行带注释的操作说明，按键盘I健即可进入编辑模式，键盘上下键确定输入位置\n\n进入编辑模式：\n\n小写i：在光标所在行位置停止不动开始写入内容\n\n大写I：在光标所在行行首开始写入内容\n\n小写a：在光标所在行当前字符后开始写入内容\n\n大写A：在光标所在行行尾开始写入内容\n\n小写o：在光标所在行下一行开始写入内容\n\n大写O：在光标所在行上一行开始写入内容\n\n退出编辑模式：\n\n:w：保存文本\n\n:q：退出编辑模式\n\n:w!：强制保存，在root用户下即使文本只读也可以强制保存\n\n:q!：强制退出，所有改动不生效\n\n:wq：保存并退出\n\n> 以上操作一定要记住，:号也是命令的一部分，退不出来是因为把冒号忘记了\n\n> 操作参考git commit --amend 以及退出 vim 编辑器_vmespmvk的博客-CSDN博客\n\n\n# 0925分之推送报错——commit未出分支上，需要把commit重回分支\n\n今天继续更新了一些网站样式，但由于中途好奇，用git checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\nTommyZeng@TommyLaptop MINGW64 /c/Tommy/DevProjectLocal/Blog-Vuepress (master|REBASE 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: You are not currently on a branch.\nTo push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)\nstate now, use\n\n    git push origin

解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的HEAD指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (HEAD) HEAD@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

#删除文件夹\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 批量删除/新建文件后同步至仓库\n\n我们主要讲怎么批量删除/新建文件\n\n步骤\n\n第一步: 直接资源管理器(我的电脑)里删掉想要删除的文件, 或直接新建想要的文件 然后在git bash里输入git add .(注意.与add之间空一格)把改动添加到缓存 然后用git commit -m "clear"一次性全部删除\n\n> "引号里不一定要写clear, 任意字母都可以,但切记不能空着"\n\n这是不是就不用一个个文件commit确认，特省事情\n\n\n\n# 推送上传至仓库\n\n提示\n\n文件修改完后,用git push即可推送本地仓库至远程仓库即可\n\n注意\n\n网上有说第一次推送仓库的时候好像得用这行代码的, 2022/04/02测试了几个仓库,都不用执行这步,可忽略\n\ngit push -u origin main #第一次推送main分支时使用-u指令\ngit push origin main\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n做到这一步会不会对这个图理解更深了?\n\nworkspace: 本地工作区 staging area: 缓存区/暂存区 local repository: 本地仓库 remote repository: 远程仓库\n\n用一张图来表达就是\n\n\n# 4.下载仓库内容至本地\n\n警告\n\n下载仓库内容到本地使用代码\n\ngit pull origin main # 获取远程分支main并合并到当前分支\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> 注意一定时main分支, github在2020年把主分支从默认的main改成了main\n\n完成后即可按上面的增删步骤管理仓库内容\n\n\n# 避坑\n\n网上很多帖子会查出各种命令如\n\ngit add -a . #这个实测没啥用" ."就可以了\n\n递归删除法(删除全部文件)\ngit rm xxx                                                # 删除index中的文件\ngit rm -r *   # 递归删除文件(可全删)      \n\ngit commit -m \'add more files\'一次提交所有文件\n\ngit status \t#告知你文件情况\ngit commit -m \'first commit\'\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n这些命令基本都能用, 不过有些杂乱,且让人晕头转向, 不用太在意这些\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第二部分：git连接github\n\n两者通信依赖ssh或者http进行连接，ssh是电脑长期连接拉去数据时最方便的方案，操作流程如下：\n\n\n# 一、 生成 ssh 密钥\n\n# 1. 打开终端\n\n * 在 mac 或 linux 上，你可以直接打开 terminal 应用程序。\n * 在 windows 上，你可以使用 powershell 或者如果安装了 git，可以使用 git bash。\n\n# 2. 运行 ssh 密钥生成命令\n\n * 在终端中，输入以下命令来生成一个新的 ssh 密钥：\n   \n   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c "your_email@example.com"\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   * ssh-keygen 是用于生成 ssh 密钥的命令。\n   * -t rsa 指定密钥类型为 rsa，这是一种常用的密钥算法。\n   * -b 4096 指定密钥长度为 4096 位，这比默认的 2048 位更安全。\n   * -c 后面跟的是一个注释，通常是你的邮箱地址，用于帮助你识别这个密钥。这个邮箱应该是你的 github 注册邮箱。\n\n# 3. 指定密钥保存位置\n\n * 当运行上述命令后，系统会询问你保存密钥的位置。如果你接受默认位置（通常是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa），直接按回车即可。如果你已经有了一个 ssh 密钥，系统会提示你是否要覆盖它。如果不想覆盖，可以输入一个新的文件名。\n\n# 4. 设置密钥密码\n\n * 接下来，系统会提示你输入一个密码（passphrase）。这是一个可选步骤，但为了增加安全性，建议设置一个密码。\n * 这个密码每次使用这个密钥时都会被要求输入，可以防止未经授权的用户使用你的密钥。\n * 输入密码后，系统会要求你再次确认。\n\n完成这些步骤后，你的新电脑上就会生成一个新的 ssh 密钥对。接下来，你需要将生成的公钥（.pub 文件）添加到你的 github 账户中，这样 github 就可以识别并信任从你的新电脑发出的 ssh 连接请求了。\n\n> 在 ssh 密钥生成过程中，当系统提示你输入密钥密码（passphrase）时，你可能注意到在输入时看不到任何反馈（例如星号或点），这是正常的。ssh 密钥生成工具为了安全考虑，不会在终端显示密码字符。即使你看不到输入的内容，你的输入是有效的。以下是这一步骤的详细说明：\n> \n> \n> # 输入 ssh 密钥密码\n> \n>  1. 输入密码时无可视反馈：\n>     \n>     * 当系统提示你输入密码时，即使你在键盘上输入，终端也不会显示任何字符。这是为了防止旁观者看到密码长度或模式。\n>     * 正常输入你的密码即可，即使看不到任何字符变化。\n> \n>  2. 确认密码：\n>     \n>     * 输入完密码后，按下回车键。然后，系统会要求你再次输入密码以进行确认。\n>     * 同样，在输入确认密码时，你也不会在终端看到任何可视反馈。\n>     * 再次输入相同的密码，并按回车键。\n> \n>  3. 完成密钥生成：\n>     \n>     * 如果两次输入的密码相同，系统就会生成 ssh 密钥，并保存到指定的文件中。\n>     * 你会看到一条消息，确认你的公钥和私钥的保存位置，以及一个随机生成的图案，表示你的密钥的指纹。\n> \n> \n> # 后续步骤\n> \n>  * 检查密钥：完成密钥生成后，你可以在指定的目录（通常是 ~/.ssh）下找到两个文件：一个是私钥（例如 id_rsa），另一个是公钥（例如 id_rsa.pub）。\n>  * 添加公钥到 github：将公钥（.pub 文件的内容）添加到你的 github 账户中，以便 github 可以识别你的新设备。\n> \n> 记住，私钥是非常敏感的，必须保持安全，不要分享或发送给任何人。公钥是可以安全分享的部分，用于在服务如 github 上进行身份验证。\n\n\n\n# 二、复制 ssh 公钥\n\n首先，你需要复制你刚生成的 ssh 公钥（.pub 文件）的内容。假设你使用的是默认的文件名和位置，你的公钥文件将是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub。你可以使用下面的命令来快速复制公钥内容到剪贴板：\n\n * 在 macos 或 linux 上：\n   \n   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   \n   （如果 pbcopy 不可用，你可以手动打开该文件并复制内容）\n\n * 在 windows 上使用 git bash：\n   \n   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   \n\n\n# 三、添加 ssh 公钥到 github\n\n然后，将复制的公钥添加到你的 github 账户：\n\n 1. 登录到你的 github 账户。\n 2. 打开设置：点击右上角的头像，然后选择“settings”（设置）。\n 3. 添加 ssh 密钥：\n    * 在设置页面的侧边栏中，点击“ssh and gpg keys”。\n    * 点击“new ssh key”或“add ssh key”按钮。\n    * 在“title”字段中，给你的密钥一个容易识别的名称。这个名称是为了帮助你以后记住这个密钥是用在哪台电脑上的。\n    * 在“key”字段中，粘贴你之前复制的公钥。\n    * 点击“add ssh key”来保存新的密钥。\n\n\n\n# 四、 测试 ssh 连接\n\n完成公钥添加后，测试一下是否能够通过 ssh 连接到 github：\n\n * 打开终端或 git bash。\n * 输入以下命令：\n   \n   ssh -t git@github.com\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n * 如果是第一次连接 github，可能会看到一个关于服务器身份的警告。输入 yes 继续。\n * 如果一切设置正确，你将看到一条欢迎信息，如：“hi [username]! you\'ve successfully authenticated, but github does not provide shell access.”\n\n这个欢迎信息表示 ssh 设置正确，并且你已经成功地通过 ssh 连接到了 github。\n\n\n\n# 五、开始使用 ssh 进行 git 操作\n\n一旦 ssh 设置完成，你就可以开始使用 ssh 进行 git 操作了，例如克隆、推送或拉取仓库。使用 ssh url 而不是 https url 来克隆或操作你的仓库。\n\n例如，克隆仓库的命令将类似于：\n\ngit clone git@github.com:username/repo.git\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n这些步骤确保了你可以安全地通过 ssh 与你的 github 仓库交互。\n\n\n\n# 常见问题解决\n\n# 无法连接服务的解决方法\n\n这部分如果是长期连接会用到ssh，这里有个坑是git的代理设置不对导致没有走上网的端口导致连不上，对应的报错代码如下：\n\nfailed to connect to github.com port 443 after 21111 ms: couldn\'t connect to server\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n如出现类似问题，可以试着用以下的代码，大概率可以解决。\n\ngit config --global http.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890\ngit config --global https.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 实战操作案例——git分支推送历史功能\n\n更新出现异常解决办法\n\n因为很喜欢给博客添加新功能，但又很容易出现不明bug，应该充分利用git的定档备份功能，出现问题后及时回滚\n\n显示分支提交命令，会显示出提交历史，和提交代码\n\ngit log  #退出按q即可\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n研究git checkout和git reset的区别，以及两者在操作上的区别\n\n\n# 实战操作方法\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况一：修改提交了commit且push\n\n方法一：\n\ngit reset --hard head^ #一个^代表一个版本，倒退^^两个版本，~100=回退100个版本\ngit reset --hard id #回退到指定的id码\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n> 这个方法不推荐，因为会直接覆盖掉回退前的记录。(虽然不是真的删了)\n> \n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 直接变成 1 –> 2\n\n这个时候再push会提示线上版本比线下版本新，所以的强制提交\n\ngit push -f #强制提交\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n方法二：\n\ngit revert commit_id #用log里的版本号完全替代掉commit_id这几个字符\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该命令意思是撤销，但保留提交记录\n\n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 变成 1 –> 2 --\x3e 3 –>4 将回退到2但以2作为主体新建新的4号commit\n> \n> 注意： 操作中commit_id应写需要被移除的版本号，而上面reset则是输入要去到的版本号\n\n输入完成后会进入和git commit --amend一样的界面，用i进入输入模式，在revert “”的冒号里输入更新的名称，输入:wq回车退出。\n\nrevert命令可以直接push，不需要担心push不上去，因为是新建的commit，不会出现线上版本比线下版本好的报错。\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况二：修改并提交了，但没有push\n\n 1. git reset --soft #撤销commit\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. git reset --mixed 撤销commit和add两个动作\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n> 以上两个办法都不会真正删除文件，git中依旧可以查找出并还原，方便在各个版本间穿梭\n\n查看完整提交历史\n\ngit reflog \n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n# 0924分支推送记录\n\n当天由于更新出了bug，需要回滚到之前的版本，出现了很多问题，最核心的问题是\n\n * 回滚后无法提交git push。\n\n * 回退版本的reset和revert指令都不好用\n\n * git commit --amend指令很难用（其实是看错了操作方法）\n\n# git操作收获——commit --amend\n\ngit commit --amend #修改提交信息（用于修改最近一次提交的提交信息）\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该模式下默认会显示很多行带注释的操作说明，按键盘i健即可进入编辑模式，键盘上下键确定输入位置\n\n进入编辑模式：\n\n小写i：在光标所在行位置停止不动开始写入内容\n\n大写i：在光标所在行行首开始写入内容\n\n小写a：在光标所在行当前字符后开始写入内容\n\n大写a：在光标所在行行尾开始写入内容\n\n小写o：在光标所在行下一行开始写入内容\n\n大写o：在光标所在行上一行开始写入内容\n\n退出编辑模式：\n\n:w：保存文本\n\n:q：退出编辑模式\n\n:w!：强制保存，在root用户下即使文本只读也可以强制保存\n\n:q!：强制退出，所有改动不生效\n\n:wq：保存并退出\n\n> 以上操作一定要记住，:号也是命令的一部分，退不出来是因为把冒号忘记了\n\n> 操作参考git commit --amend 以及退出 vim 编辑器_vmespmvk的博客-csdn博客\n\n\n# 0925分之推送报错——commit未出分支上，需要把commit重回分支\n\n今天继续更新了一些网站样式，但由于中途好奇，用git checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\ntommyzeng@tommylaptop mingw64 /c/tommy/devprojectlocal/blog-vuepress (master|rebase 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: you are not currently on a branch.\nto push the history leading to the current (detached head)\nstate now, use\n\n    git push origin

head。\n\n可能发生的问题：\n\ngit中的head指针能确定您当前的工作版本（以及放置在项目工作目录中的文件）。通常，当检出正确的分支名称时，git会在您创建新提交时自动移动head指针。您将自动进入所选分支的最新提交。\n\n当您选择通过commit哈希值进行checkout时，git将不会为您执行此操作。结果是，当您进行更改并提交它们时，这些更改将不属于任何分支。\n\n# 解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的head指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (head) head@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

How to introduce yourself at the beginning of a interview ？\n\n（1）如何在 面试 开头做好 自我介绍 ？ You must also be prepared for the common mistakes people make in interviews. Be assertive not aggressive, find a middle way between boasting and passivity. This is an opportunity for you to talk about your personal characteristics and skills. Remember to remain relevant and to stress achievements that translate into strengths you would bring to the job. 你必须防止别人会在面试中犯的错误。表现得肯定自信但是不咄咄逼人，不吹嘘自己也不处于被动状态。这是一个你很好的谈你的个人特色和技巧的机会。记住提到你今后在公司中将能发挥的相关成就。\n\n\n# 2. What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n\n（2）合理地描述自身的优点和缺点 Question: 提问：你的优点和缺点各是什么？ Hint:Talk about relevant strengths for the job and irrelevant weaknesses. If you can, mention a personal weakness that could be seen as a professional strength; I\'m a workaholic! (though avoid being seen as insincere) 提示:谈谈跟你工作相关的优势和不相关的缺点。如果可以的话，提出看起来像职业优点的个人缺点；例如我是一个工作狂！（当然尽量不显得虚伪。） For example 例如：“我在做展示时候一般会紧张，但是通过展示我又会获得更多自信。”\n\n\n# 3. Why did you leave your last job?\n\n（3）当被问及上一份工作的离职原因，怎么回答？ Question: 提问：为什么放弃上一份岗位？ Hint: Don\'t lie and don\'t speak badly of your past employer 提示：不要说谎，不要说前一任老板的坏话\n\nFor example:\n\nI feel that there is no room for growth in my last job, and i need a more challenging position. 我觉得上一份工作没有上升的空间了，我需要一份更有挑战性的工作。\n\nOr：\n\nI feel that I have already maximized my talents in my previous role. I am only 28 years old now and hope to take on more responsibilities and embrace more challenges. 我觉得我已经在我的上一份岗位上发挥了所有的才能，我现在只是28岁，希望自己能够承担更多的责任，接受更多挑战。\n\n\n# 4. What are your salary requirements?\n\n（4）当被问及期望薪资，怎么回答？ Question: 提问：你对薪资的要求是怎么样的？ Hint:State that although salary is not your primary consideration you do have to pay the bills. 提示：传达出“工资不是你 找工作 的第一标准，但是日子还是要过的”的意思即可。 For example “薪资水平不是我衡量一份工作的第一标准，但是我也是需要还各类账单的，所以任何合理的出价我都是会考虑的。” Say you would be open to any reasonable offer and if pressed for a figure give a number that shows you have researched the local job market. 如果按照以上的回答了，对方还要求给出一个范围的话就提出一个跟当地此类工作水平的薪资水平。\n\n\n# 5. Pay attention to the simple questions\n\n（5）当被问及看似与无关工作的细节，如兴趣爱好等，怎么回答？ Sometimes an interview question might seem very simple but, don’t be deceived, there is always a reason for them asking that question. Here is some questions & answers： 有时候一个 面试 问题看上去也许非常的简单，但是不要被蒙骗了。HR问你的任何问题都是有他的理由的，下面就是一些示例： Q: If you had to compare yourself with any animal; which one would it be and why? 问：如果把你比作一种动物，你觉得你是哪一种？为什么？ A: 答：狮子，因为虽然他们很独立，他们也能很好地团队合作。 Q: Describe how a sport or hobby taught you a lesson in teamwork? 问：说一下哪种体育运动或者爱好教你很好的团队合作？ A: 答：大学时期，我的篮球教练教我怎么在最有利于团队的情况下传球，所以现在我总是会从考虑团队利益的情况下行动。 Q: 问：你一般读什么书或者杂志？ Hint:The books you read tell the interviewer something about your personality. Mentioning a relevant journal would be a good idea, saying you don’t like to read would be a bad idea! 提示：人们通过你的书知道你的性格，所以提到一两份刊物会是不错的回答，说你不喜欢阅读是很坏的回答方式。 A: 答：一份有关公司行业内的商业杂志。 Question: 问：你在学校最喜欢的科目是什么？为什么？ Hint: Mention anything that shows an interest in the employer\'s kind of work. Bring up any interesting or unusual projects in that area. 提示：提到跟面试公司经营范围内有关系的科目，展示你对它的兴趣，提到那个学科涉及到的一些有趣的或者不寻常的项目。 Question: 问：你在空闲时间喜欢做什么？ Hint: It’s good to have strong outside interests and if they are pastimes that would be an asset to the job, so much the better. 提示：提到一个户外兴趣很不错，如果那还是一种对该工作来说是一种资产的消遣方式的话，那就更好了。\n\n\n# 6. Do you have any questions for us?\n\n（6） 当HR问：“你还有什么问题要问吗”，该怎么回答？ Question: 提问：你有什么问题要问我的吗？ Show you have been attentive during the interview; develop questions that have arisen during the interview. 这个问题是要看你是否在面试过程中集中精神了，可以扩展在面试中提到的问题。 Towards the end of your interview you should have asked the key question about what happens next. Something like “How soon will you make a decision on whom you plan to hire? 在面试的最后，你应该要问面试官一些重点问题，例如接下来的程序是怎样的。再如“多久会收到是否录用的决定”，这会给你自己一个时间范围 For example: Yes - about your ethical policy, and your carbon footprint...I was wondering whether you are planning to reduce your carbon footprint and whether all your products are ethically sourced? 其他回答例如：是的，有关你们的伦理道德政策，还有你们的碳足迹，我在好奇你们是否会降低你们的碳排放量，是否你们的所有产品都是从伦理道德角度出发去寻找生产商的。\n\n\n# 7. Tell me about yourself.\n\n答: I was born and raised in Dalian, China. I attended the University of Beijing and received my masters degree in Economics. I have worked for 5 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for various companies including Rossi Consultants, Peoples Insurance of China and Pepsi. I enjoy playing soccer in my free time and traveling. 答: Ive just graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Computers Science. During the summers, I worked as a systems administrator for a small company to help pay for my education. 评语: 这个问题的目的是想大概地了解你，所以无需讲太多细节的东西。你的回答通常会帮助面试官决定下个问题问什么。除了给对方一个整体的印象，最重要的是着重讲和工作有关的经验。工作经验是大多数面试中最重要的环节，比学历更重要\n\n\n# 8. 问: What type of position are you looking for?\n\n答: Im interested in an entry level (beginning) position. 答: Im looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience. 答: I would like any position for which I qualify. 评语:对于一个英语非母语的申请人，许多公司期望你能从低做起，慢慢弥补语言方面的不足。就算你以前很成功有多年经验，也应当有这个心理准备。\n\n\n# 9.问: Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position?\n\n英语面试问题及回答 答: I am more interested in a full-time position. However, I would also consider a part-time position. 评语: 尽量留最大的余地争取机会。因为只要工作拿到了，以后的事情就容易把握，主动性大多了。 10.问: Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job? 答: I advised customers on financial matters. After I consulted the customer, I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis. 评语: 提到过往工作经验时，注意越详细越好。新移民最容易犯的错误之一是讲过去经历时太过笼统。雇主是想知道你到底做什么以及你做得怎么样，你讲得越详细，他们就越能知道你是否在行。你可以换着用一些不同的词汇来形容，而且尽量不要每句话都用“I”开头。记得用过去时态。\n\n\n# 10. 问: What is your greatest strength?\n\n答: I work well under pressure. When there is a deadline (a time by which the work must be finished), I can focus on the task at hand (current project) and structure my work schedule well. I remember one week when I had to get 6 new customer reports out by Friday at ## I finished all the reports ahead of time without having to work overtime. 答: I am an excellent communicator. People trust me and come to me for advice. One afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome (difficult) customer who felt he was not being served well. I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together. 答: I am a trouble shooter. When there was a problem at my last job, the manager would always ask me to solve it. Last summer, the LAN server at work crashed. The manager was desperate and called me in (requested my help) to get the LAN back online. After taking a look at the daily backup, I detected the problem ahttp://www.wenku1.comnd the LAN was up and running (working) within the hour. 评语: 不用谦虚，充满自信地把自己最好的方面都抖出来。记得要给一些具体的例子，举例时变化用词。\n\n\n# 12. 问: What is your greatest weakness?\n\n答: I am overzealous (work too hard) and become nervous when my co-workers are not pulling their weight (doing their job). However, I am aware of this problem, and before I say anything to anyone, I ask myself why the colleague is having difficulties. 答: I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisified. However, I began setting time-limits for myself If I noticed this happening. 评语: 这其实是一个很巧妙的问题，你要讲得出一个其实是优点的缺点。比如工作太认真啦，对自己对人要求很高啦，工作很追求完美啦，等等。在讲到缺点后要记得说你一直在致力于改善。\n\n\n# 13. 问:Why do you want to work for us?\n\n答: After following your firms progress for the last 3 years, I am convinced that Smith and Sons are becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be part of the team. 答: I am impressed by the qualitiy of your products. I am sure that I would be a convincing salesman because I truly believe that the Atomizer is the best product on the market today. 评语: 对这个问题你要事前做研究，通过看公司网站，其他有关信息等。越了解公司，对你越有利。\n\n\n# 14. 问: When can you begin?\n\n答: Immediately. 答: As soon as you would like me to begin. 评语: 充分表示你想要工作!\n\n\n# 15. 对于英语非母语的人来说，最重要和最难的是用英语讲述大量细节，尤其是复杂的细节。\n\n然而，雇主是很有必要知道你能否把工作范畴内的细节表达清楚，这对你是否胜任至关重要。不要太过担心语法问题。只要用词够多，内容够细，只要不影响理解，语法往往不是那么重要。 面试时招聘人员总会问你："Do you have any questions?"其中一忌就是用"nothing"来回答这个问题。问什么问题，对你的印象分有帮助，显示你是一个用心的人。一般来说，围绕着这些话题来问比较得体： the competitive environment in which the organization operates 公司营运所处的竞争环境 executive management styles 管理高层的风格 what obstacles the organization anticipates in meeting its goals 公司在达到其目标过程中预计会遇到什么障碍 how the organizations goals have changed over the past three to five years 公司的经营方向在过去三到五年内有什么变化 第一次面试，或者在双方未有确定的意向以前，除非是已经到了签OFFER的阶段，最好不要问待遇如何。那样显得你更关心公司能为你做什么，而不是你为公司能做什么。 具体来说，你可以问以下问题：\n\n 1. What are the main objectives and responsibilities of the position?\n 2. How does the company expect these objectives to be met?\n 3. What obstacles are commonly encountered in reaching these objectives?\n 4. What is the desired time frame for reaching the objectives?\n 5. What resources are available from the company and what must be found elsewhere to reach the objectives?\n\n\n# 16. 教育背景：\n\n简明扼要，实话实说尽管你在简历中对自己的教育背景作了介绍，但在面试时，面试官还有可能就此方面提问。还是事先做点准备吧。\n\n\n# ①I：what is your major?\n\nA：My major is Business Administration.

I think the most important thing for me is having a good relationship with my family members and my friends. My family has always been very closeknit， and my friend sand I spend a lot of time together. Without that I would be much less happy than I am. ⑥I：What makes you angry? A：Dishonesty. It‘s unacceptable. ⑦I：What are your personal weaknesses? A：I‘m afraid I’m a poor talker. I‘m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time.

I was surprised at their spoken English because they appeared to be a Chinese American. I just couldn\'t decline them.” 在多人竞争某一职位时，简单的“可以理解的”初级英语层次显然不能够凸显个人实力。 William Hill先生建议应聘者不妨关注一下自己的英语表达和发音，中国式英语是应该避免的， 多了解你即将应聘的外企的国家文化，因为每个国家的文化不同会使面试过程的氛围也不同。 相对来讲美国企业的面试比较relaxing，有点像一般的聊天，只不过聊的内容不是普通的“闲聊”。 如果在外企英文面试中能准确地融入一些该国的俚语，则你的面试过程将会非常的愉快。 2、外企招聘时看重哪些英语证书？ 如果外企的面试官是老外的话，那么国内的一些英语考试如CET4、CET6、TEM4、TEM8 等可能作用并不明显，除了老外不了解这些考试外更多的在于这些考试并没有对考生的口语能力 进行测试。关于这个问题William Hill说：“I don\'t think candidates with those certificates are up to par, because what we focus on is the communicating ability. And, as is known, CET and TEM don\'t seem to test one\'s speaking skills. But he who owns an IELTS or TOEFL certificate may be preferred.” 可见雅思、托福等出国英语证书可能在一定程度上增强应聘者的竞争力。 常见典型问题拆招： 3、关于介绍自己的：Could you say something about yourself? Could you sell yourself within a few minutes? 这个问题可以说是大众问题了，通过这个问题，面试官一方面大致把握一下你的英语水平， 一方面找到和你交流的突破点，探寻本质，打破沙锅是人力资源经理的一惯作风， 因此回答这个问题时务必事实求是，否则后面很可能无法自圆其说。不过这个问题其实也不复杂， 外教William Hill告诉我们说与其说这个是测试应聘者的问题，不如说是应聘者卖弄自己 英语的大好机会，So don\'t miss the boat！ 你可以从以下几个方面突出自己：职业技能强项，该技能的深入程度，该技能完成过的项目 以及自己其他相关方面的深入研究和学习、探索，注意突出个性。请不要在自己的姓名、年龄、 毕业学校、兴趣爱好等方面浪费时间，也不用再把你的简历背诵一遍，因为老外已经看过你的CV了。 时间可以根据情况控制在2-3分钟的样子。注意外企英语面试是口头表达的过程，建议在随后的互动 过程中多多使用口语化的表达，尽量让自己融入整个对话（Conversation），而不是在教条式的背诵文章。 4、关于应聘动机的：Why do you wanna work for us? What makes you come here today? 面试官想了解一下你的求职动机，看看你对公司是否有所了解。显然这个功课是你来面试之前 就应该做好的，所以千万别说开始面试了还不知道这个公司是做什么的。请在回答这个问题的 时候充满信心，不要说是来试试的（you really wanna take a try?），如果能事先将公司信息整理 好并梳理一下和自己的职业技能相结合来介绍，则可谓Perfect Response。 5、关于你的弱点：What do you think is your greatest weakness? May I know it? 注意后面那句是客气的，千万别说No，也别说"I don\'t think I have any weakness"。 客观地评价一下自己确实存在但对工作并不重要的缺点是一个不错的办法，当然别忘了 要提一下你将采取什么样的办法来克服或弥补自己的缺点。 6、关于你过去的工作：How do you like your last job? Why did ya leave your last job? 面试官想通过你对过去的工作的看法，了解你对今后的工作态度。如果你说你不喜欢你过去的 工作，那么你将面临“既然不喜欢为什么却会选择”这样的难题，最终结果是“缺乏判断力或者没有主见”。 事实上你既然做过以前的工作，那么应该多少还是比较喜欢的，不妨谈谈过去的工作特点和你所负责 的主要任务，但要突出过去的工作趋于平淡且失去挑战性，你可以在更艰巨的任务和岗位中发挥能力。 同时面试官极有可能问你以前的同事和上司的一些问题，切记不要把责任归咎到别人身上。 7、关于你将来的打算：How long do you propose to work here? 这个问题对职场老手来说简直就是a piece of cake。简洁的几句话表达出你希望在这个公司一直 工作下去即可，同时要体现出你的上进心，渴望与公司一起发展和进步，不断提升自己。 8、反问的机会：Ok, now if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. “Nope, I have none, thanks!”这样的回答就完全错了。抓住这个机会，把事先准备好的问题 和盘托出，多了解一些关于公司发展、职位要求、员工培训、员工晋升、员工福利等方面的问题。 其实外企英语面试并没有什么特别之处，话题内容上也跳不出中文面试的框框，无非是用英语来 表达而已。在某些特定职位的招聘上，可能外企更看重的是个人的职业能力而对英语表达要求甚低； 或者在某些特定的条件下没有太多的竞争者，应聘者不需要具备非常好的英语听说能力就可拿到offer。 但这些情况并不影响我们对自身竞争力的提升，卓越的英语听说能力必将为你的职场生涯带来裨益。 一些可能用得上的俚语表达： 注意: 1、up to par 达到标准。 2、I won\'t let the cat out of the bag. 我会严守秘密。 3、get on the ball 开始（做事） 4、a piece of cake 形容非常容易 5、face the music 勇于承担责任\n\n\n# What is important to you in a job?\n\nMention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, t he feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.\n\n\n# Why do you want to work for this organization?\n\nCite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working condit ions.

If you are asked this at the outset, it\'s best to say, "Why don\'t we discuss salary after you decide whether I\'m right for the job?

If you need a clue about what to ask for, say, " Can you discuss your salary range with me?"\n\n1## What would you do if....? This question is designed to test your reposes.

What are the next steps to take?” Boy, are you eager? They’d be lucky to have you!\n\n准备好你要提出的问题 在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先， 不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。 这里有风个备选问题： 请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会 参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？\n\n考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。 Have questions of your own. Toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” Do you have any questions for me? You must have questions. First, don’t rush into your answer. Look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. Here is a handful of potential questions:\n\nHow would you describe a typical workday?/What is the best part of working at this company for you? Are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/Why did you join the company? Interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.\n\n常见问题做好准备\n\n针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案： 谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？ / 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历 和大学活动与这份工作有何关联?\n\n最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职， 参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要 把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。 Have answers ready for these popular interview questions:\n\nTell me a little about yourself./What interests you most about this position?/Where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/What is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./What are your greatest strengths?/What did you like about your last job?/What separates you from other candidates?/How do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work?\n\nMost importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. Think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. Then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)The problem you encountered, 2)How you analyzed it, and 3)The solution you implemented.\n\n面试中的“陷阱”问题\n\n序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后 心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”， 那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。 第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的 缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么， 都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性 特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。 如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多 份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢： “我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。”\n\nThe best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. If interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. But if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“Hey, I enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.\n\nFirst is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. The trap question is some variaton on“ What is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ What is your area of weakness?” The real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. Whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. Instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. For example: “I prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. I sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ Sometimes I have a hard time saying no to people, and I end up taking on more than my share of work.” If you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “I’m a perfectionist. I need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure I get everything right. ”\n\n为何要离开你以前的公司\n\n对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题 （以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位 上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境 不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。 Be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. These questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“Why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“It was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.\n\n面试难题的应答策略 （上） 求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。 一、你来这里能干什么？ 对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略： 1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。 2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。 3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。 4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。 5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。 二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？\n\n用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略： 1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。 所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因： （a）专业对口； （b）公司有发展； （c）工作环境优越； （d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"； （e）有更多到外国工作的机会； （f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣； （g）离家近； （h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染） 2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。 3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。\n\n面试难题的应答策略 （下） 三、你自认为有什么优缺点？ 主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人， 往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出， 那就不适合做某项工作。 答问策略： 1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这 类问题就不知如何是好了。 2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个 缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。 3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。 4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有， 又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己： 对应聘有利的优点： --好学习、肯钻研。 --脑子好使，记忆力强。 --办事认真，一丝不苟。 --有干劲，不惜力。 --好相处，跟谁都合得来。 --有比较丰富的阅历。 --喜欢接受挑战性的课题。 --不交女友（男友）不成家。 对应聘有利的缺点： --有名利思想： （a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。 （b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。 （c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待， 克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。） --急脾气 （a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。 （b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。 （c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！ --有时主观： （a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。 （b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。 （c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。 --不拘小节： （a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。 （b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。 （c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。） --抠门儿、吝啬： （a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。 （b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！ （该人适合管理财务工作）。 （c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。 --害羞、胆小： （a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。 （该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作） （b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。 （c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。 有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。） --不顾家： （a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。 （b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。 "所以，我不是一个好丈夫。 （c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。 5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。 四、你善于与什么人相处? 主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事 沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、 促销等任务。答问策略： 1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明 你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。 2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。 所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。 3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位， 就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。 4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。 五、你为什么经常想调动工作？ 主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因， 是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆 不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略： 1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。 2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有： （a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）； （b）跟原单位的领导不和； （c）想多挣钱； （d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。 3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）： （a）能实现个人的抱负； （b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展； （c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。\n\n这里只是几个常见的英文面试问题，以供参考，多见于外企 What Are Your Weaknesses? This is the most dreaded question of all. Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.”\n\nWhy Should We Hire You? Summarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be a great addition to your team.”\n\nWhy Do You Want to Work Here? The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.”\n\nWhat Are Your Goals? Sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.”\n\nWhy Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job? If you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.” If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.”\n\nWhen Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job? The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.”\n\nWhat Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t? What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102 rmation to be more user-friendly.”\n\nWhat Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You? It’s time to pull out your old per&＃102 rmance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.”\n\nWhat Salary Are You Seeking? It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?”\n\nIf You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be?

First, I think I am an excellent graduate. Though there will be a transition period, I will soon make profits for the company. What\'s more, I think if a company is willing to pay a high salary for a post, it also indicates its importance. And only in this situation can I be convinced that I can get more learning opportunities and better prospects. 我的薪酬要求可能偏高，我希望我的起薪不低于4000元。首先我认为自己是一名优秀的大学毕业生，虽然刚到企业需要一段过渡期，但很快我就能为企业创造价值。而且，我也认为,一个企业如果可以开出较高的薪水，可以证明企业对这个职位的重视度。在这样的情况下，我才有信心能从企业获得更多的学习机会和更好的发展机遇。 Case Two Interviewer: I\'d like to know your salary expectations. 我想了解一下，你期望的薪水是多少？ Applicant: Since I am a recent graduate , there will be a transition period after I enter the company. So at the beginning, the profits I make for the company will be limited and I don\'t have specific requirements. But man has to survive.

Applicant: I hope to get a kind of learning, to get skills from my work. Though I have studied in school for nearly 16 years, I have only learned knowledge. In the university, I got no chance to see real life and didn\'t get working skills. So I want to learn some working skills and become a professional in an industry. 我最希望得到的是一种学习，能让我学到工作的技能。虽然我已经在学校学习了快16年,但只是学习到了知识，在学校里，没有机会接触到真正的社会，没有掌握一项工作技能，所以我最希望获得一项工作的技能，能够成为某一个行业领域的专业人士。 Interviewer: Why did you choose us? 你为什么选择到我们公司来应聘?\n\nApplicant: As the saying goes, "well begun is half done". Your company is a famous one in the industry and boasts a high reputation. I hope to choose your company as the beginning of my career.

Applicant: I hope this job will give me a chance to take responsibility. In more than ten years\' of study as a student, I have never taken any responsibility in any real sense or earned money for a company. I think people can only become mature by taking on responsibility. I hope this work will give me the chance to develop fully. 我希望这份工作可以给我一个承担职责的机会。在过去十几年的学习生涯中，作为一名学生，我从来没有在真正意义上承担过责任，为一个企业盈利。我认为，人是通过承担一定的责任才能成长、成熟的，我希望这份工作能够给予我发展的机会。 以上例子从学习和承担职责的角度出发，都十分注重能力的培养，这会让面试官觉得求职者不是一个功利心很强的人，给面试官留下好印象。 面试：如何应对角色扮演的问题 角色扮演是各大外企招聘时经常采用的方式之一。回答这类问题的要点是应聘者一定要设身处地、把自己当作角色中的人物。另外，基于任何角色提出的问题根本的目的是要考察应聘者对公司的态度，所以在角色扮演时，要把自己想象成该角色，也要站在全公司的角度来考虑问题，所谓大处着眼、小处着手，方能立于不败之地。 Case One Interviewer: You are a director of our company and you are in charge of a project. There are six people in the project team. Due to different opinions, the team is split into two parts at a meeting and they are debating ferociously. At this time, as a leader, what will you do to coordinate the two parts? If the two parts disagree, what will you do then? 如果你已经成为我公司的一名主管，由你负责管理一个项目。在该项目的团队中一共有六个人。在一次会议上，由于观点不同，团队分成两派，,进行了激烈的争论，这时，你作为领导者该如何协调？如果两方不能达成共识，你又会怎么办？ Applicant: First, I will listen to both sides carefully, and make my own judgment. If I prefer one side, I will give facts and data to persuade the other side. If my opinion is between the two sides, I will also give facts and data to prove my opinion right. It is better that the two sides will agree on it. If not, I will stick to my opinion and allow the colleagues who keep reserved opinions to give more data and communicate with me. In short, my principle is that everything should be based on data and facts. Every colleague has the right to express his opinion. I will try my best to make all people agree on one thing. If I fail, I will make my decision, as a leader. 首先我会仔细聆听双方的观点和理由，并作出我的判断。如果我倾向于其中一方的观点，我会拿出数据和事实来说服另一方；如果我的观点是介于两者之间，我同样会基于数据和事实来证明我的立场。如果最后大家能够达成共识自然最好。如果不能，我会坚持我的观点，但允许持保留意见的同事拿出更多的数据来和我沟通。总之，我的原则是，用数据和事实说话，每一位同事都有权表达他的观点，我会尽量让大家达成共识。如果不行，那作为领导者，我会做出一个决定。 点评：该求职者能够基于数据和事实说话，既不是独断专行，也不做和事老，这充分表现了他处理问题的成熟程度。 Case Two Interviewer: You are now a team member and if your leader has made a decision but you don\'t quite agree with this decision and other members don\'t express any special opinions, what will you do? 如果你现在是一个项目的团队成员，如果你的领导已经作出了一个决定，但你个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，那你会怎么做？ Applicant: If my leader has made a decision, but I myself don\'t quite agree with this decision and other members don\'t express any special opinion, I will still express my opinion. If the leader doesn\'t agree with me, I will make my own judgment. If this decision isn\'t very important, then as a team member, I will act according to what the leader has decided. If this is a key decision, I will gather related information to support my view and try to persuade my leader. 如果我的领导已经做出了一个决定，但我个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，这时候问我仍然会提出我的意见。如果领导不同意，那我会做出自己的判断。如果我们这个决定并不是十分重要的，那么作为团队成员，我会遵照领导的决定来执行；如果是一个关键的决定，我会搜集相关的材料为我自己的观点寻找支持，力求说服领导。 点评：虽然只是一个团队成员，但该求职者仍然能够大胆地提出自己地意见，并且能够就问题做出理性的判断，能够让面试官觉得该求职者是真正站在公司的立场上看待问题，并且体现了他处理问题的成熟性。 －Occupational Experience Experience in auditing, cost accounting and taxation.有审计、成本会计和税务方面的经验。 －Working experience in foreign company.有在外资公司工作的经验者。 －Five years\' experience in foreign trade or foreignowned venture.有5年在外贸方面或外资企业工作的经验。 －Experience working with foreign companies.有在外国公司工作的经验。 －Three years of Experience in personnel recruiting.

Prepared to develop career in the commercial field -outgoing personality -Able to communicate with different levels -Good knowledge in PC operations -Proficiency in written and spoken English/Mandarin 则你相应地考虑自己的qualification的选择和表述，如你可写（与上列各项对应）： -University graduate with major in Marketing -Having actively participated in Business club‘s activities and learned accounting and management -Good in communication with people and like a lot of out door activities know how to tackle with people from all walks of life -Skillful in operating Words,Excel,Lotus1-2-3,etc -Fluent in English and studied advanced level of Mandarin 这个方法的好处是可让求职者清楚了解该职位是否适合自己，而本身资料又是否切合要求，而且，明白了各项要求后，就可依据每一点在履历表上重点提出自己在该方面的强项。突出卖点(selling point)，将之放在最吸引别人的地方，使招聘者一眼可见，有利于present自己。 工作经验的陈述 工作经验是一份resume中令招聘者相当感兴趣的一项内容，善加措词是必不可忽视的要务。 刚毕业，何来工作经验？其实，客下读书时的兼职、实习、实践，以至所曾参加的一些课外活动－协助助出版学校刊物、举办活动，展览、宣传……都可算是工作经验、不过，表达起来要有针对性地展开，列出那些与所找工作有关连的项目重点介绍，必要时更可使用summary的方式，给招聘者深入的了解。 下面这份材料的相关表这实在简陋呆板： 1996/7-1996/8 General Clerk, IBM 1995/7-1995/8 Account clerks, Manley Toy Trading 1994/6-1994/8Salesgirl,Esprit. 倘能换一种表述如： Three years of job experience in different positions have offered me opportunities to understand different job aspects. -As a General Clerk(IBM),Accounts clerk (Manley Toy Trading),I have learned how to prepare purchasing orders, place orders, handle accounting mattery, check voucher,……also(Salesgirl, Esprin)developing the technique of sellina, serving and stocking. 岂非能更好地突出个人工作经验，吸引招聘者的注意力！ Job Objective通常，一般求者只会在履历表开端简单地写上所应征的职位－"Position Applied: Management Trainee"或"I am appling for……"其实，若懂得利用这小小空间写出自己的事业目标（job objective），能显示出你对该工作的热诚及憧憬，能令招聘者对你加倍留意。 比如这个不错的例子job objective To begin as a Marketing Management Trainee, with opportunity to advance to executive level and contribute to the development of firm. 其实，这位外企人士所谈的关于准备RESUME的技巧，完全可以应用到中文简历上来。各位读者可以尝试一下。\n\n求职面试的技巧 Tricks in Job Hunting Interview Here are good answers to some of the tougher questions asked in job interviews. If you can smoothly supply answers like these during the interview, you are bound to make a good impression.\n\n\n# What is important to you in a job?\n\nMention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, the feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.\n\n\n# Why do you want to work for this organization?\n\nCite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working conditions. Stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organization.\n\n\n# Why should we employ you?\n\nPoint to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm. Mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. If the job involves management responsibilities, refer to past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team.\n\n\n# If we hire you, how long will you stay with us?\n\nAnswer by saying along these lines: "As long as my position here allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities."\n\n\n# Can we offer you a career path?\n\nReply: "I believe you could, once I know the normal progression within the organization. Can you tell me about it?" The answer may be revealing.\n\n\n# What are your greatest strengths?\n\nGive a response like one of the following: "I can see what needs to be done and do it", "I\'m wiling to make decisions", "I work well with others," "I can organize my time efficiently."\n\n\n# What are you greatest weakness?\n\nIdentify one or two, such as the following:" I tend to drive myself too hard", " I expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " I like to see a job done quickly, and I\'m critical if it isn\'t." Note these weaknesses could also be regarded as desirable qualities. The trick with this question is to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.\n\n\n# What didn\'t you like about previous jobs you\'ve held?\n\nDiscuss the things you didn\'t like, but avoid making slighting reference to any of your former employers.\n\n\n# How do you spend your leisure time?\n\nMention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.\n\n\n# Are there any weaknesses in your education or experience?\n\nTake stock of your weaknesses before the interview. Practice discussing them in a positive light. You\'ll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer. Where do you want to be five years from now? Saying that you\'d like to be president is unrealistic, yet few employers want people who are content to sit still. You might say, "in five years, I\'d like to have my boss\'s job. " If you can\'t qualify for your boss\'s job by then, you may not be the fright candidate.\n\n\n# What are your salary expectations?\n\nIf you are asked this at the outset, it\'s best to say, "Why don\'t we discuss salary after you decide whether I\'m right for the job? "But if the interviewer asks this after showing real interest in you, speak up. She or he will probably try to meet your price. If you need a clue about what to ask for, say, " Can you discuss your salary range with me?" 1### What would you do if....? This question is designed to test your reposes. For example: "What would you do if your computer broke down during an audit?" Your answer there isn\'t nearly so important as your approach to the problem. And a calm approach is best. Start by saying, "One thing I might do is ..." Then give several alternative choices. 1### What type of position are you interested in? Job titles and responsibilities vary from firm to firm . So state your skills instead, such as "I\'m good at figure work," and the positions that require these skills , such as "accounts payable." 1### Tell me something about yourself. Say you\'ll be happy to talk about yourself, and ask what the interviewer wants to know. If this point is clarified, respond. If not, tell why you feel your skills will contribute to the job and the organization. This question gives you a great opportunity to sell yourself. 1### Do you have any questions about the organization or the job? Employers like a candidate who is interested in the organization. so this is a perfect time to convey your interest and enthusiasm.\n\n面试的最后需要做些什么? 关于真正的面试最后要提醒的是：结束面试时要说：“我对这份工作非常感兴趣，我下一步要干些什么？”朋友，你是否在热切地盼望着？如果聘用你，那将是他们的幸运！ One last great tip about the actual interview: Always end the interview with, “I am very interested in the position. What are the next steps to take?” Boy, are you eager? They’d be lucky to have you! 准备好你要提出的问题 在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先，不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。这里有风个备选问题： 请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？ 考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。 Have questions of your own. Toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” Do you have any questions for me? You must have questions. First, don’t rush into your answer. Look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. Here is a handful of potential questions: How would you describe a typical workday?/What is the best part of working at this company for you? /Are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/Why did you join the company? Interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.\n\n常见问题做好准备 针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案： 谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？/ 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历和大学活动与这份工作有何关联? 最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职，参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。 Have answers ready for these popular interview questions: Tell me a little about yourself./What interests you most about this position?/Where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/What is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./What are your greatest strengths?/What did you like about your last job?/What separates you from other candidates?/How do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work? Most importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. Think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. Then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)The problem you encountered,2)How you analyzed it, and 3)The solution you implemented.\n\n面试中的“陷阱”问题 序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”，那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。 第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么，都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢：“我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。” The best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. If interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. But if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“Hey, I enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.\n\nFirst is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. The trap question is some variaton on“ What is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ What is your area of weakness?” The real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. Whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. Instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. For example: “I prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. I sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ Sometimes I have a hard time saying no to people, and I end up taking on more than my share of work.” If you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “I’m a perfectionist. I need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure I get everything right. ”\n\n为何要离开你以前的公司 对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题（以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。 Be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. These questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“Why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“It was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.\n\n面试难题的应答策略 求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。 一、你来这里能干什么？ 对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略： 1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。 2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。 3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。 4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。 5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。 二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？ 用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略： 1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因： （a）专业对口； （b）公司有发展； （c）工作环境优越； （d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"； （e）有更多到外国工作的机会； （f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣； （g）离家近； （h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染） 2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。 3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。\n\n面试难题的应答策略 （下） 三、你自认为有什么优缺点？ 主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人，往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出，那就不适合做某项工作。 答问策略： 1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这类问题就不知如何是好了。 2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。 3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。 4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有，又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己： 对应聘有利的优点： --好学习、肯钻研。 --脑子好使，记忆力强。 --办事认真，一丝不苟。 --有干劲，不惜力。 --好相处，跟谁都合得来。 --有比较丰富的阅历。 --喜欢接受挑战性的课题。 --不交女友（男友）不成家。 对应聘有利的缺点： --有名利思想： （a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。 （b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。 （c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待，克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。） --急脾气 （a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。 （b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。 （c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！ --有时主观： （a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。 （b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。 （c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。 --不拘小节： （a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。 （b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。 （c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。） --抠门儿、吝啬： （a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。 （b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！（该人适合管理财务工作）。 （c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。 --害羞、胆小： （a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。（该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作） （b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。 （c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。） --不顾家： （a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。 （b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。"所以，我不是一个好丈夫。 （c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。 5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。 四、你善于与什么人相处? 主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、促销等任务。答问策略： 1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。 2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。 3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位，就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。 4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。 五、你为什么经常想调动工作？ 主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因，是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略： 1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。 2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有： （a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）； （b）跟原单位的领导不和； （c）想多挣钱； （d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。 3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）： （a）能实现个人的抱负； （b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展； （c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。\n\n常见的英文面试问题，多见于外企 What Are Your Weaknesses? This is the most dreaded question of all. Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.” Why Should We Hire You? Summarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be a great addition to your team.” Why Do You Want to Work Here? The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.” What Are Your Goals? Sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.” Why Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job? If you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.” If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.” When Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job? The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.” What Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t? What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102;ormation to be more user-friendly.” What Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You? It’s time to pull out your old per&＃102;ormance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.” What Salary Are You Seeking? It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?” If You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be? Interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get the job done? What impression do you want to make?\n\n英文简历攻略 经常看到有人发翻译简历的贴子。其实我个人认为简历的翻译并没有定式，可自由发挥。但是有一个原则关系到别人看了你的英文简历后对你的英文水平的第一印象，那就是简历中地用词，句子，表达方式等一定要地道。也就是说不能带有太多的所谓中式英语，让别人一看就觉得很不爽。最近我有幸得到一些老外（包括非英语国家）的简历，看了以后颇有收获，拿来共享心得。题目虽然是《完全攻略》，但时间仓促，难免有理解错误，或者不完整的地方还希望大家指正，补充。总的来说，看完这些英文简历给我的感觉是：与其把中文简历翻译成英文，还不如用英文再写一个简历。这样完全按照英文的思维方式和习惯作为出发点写出的简历才会更地道。 一、简历的结构 首先，整个简历要分成若干部分：基本情况、自我介绍、教育经历、工作经历等等。这些部分如何分完全凭自己掌握。但是有些不内容是必不可少的。下面就列出我在这些简历上看到的栏目： 我注意到大部分简历的最上方（标题的位置）都是求职者的姓名和联系方式。也有某些简历用名字作为标题，然后下面的位置写上了自己的求职意向或者联系方式。而有些则是把联系方式做成页眉的效果。和这种方式能让阅读者对此人的姓名联系方式和求职意向一目了然，可以提高效率，并且对求职者有比较深刻的印象。由此可见她们的共同点是：大多以姓名作为大标题，然后再显眼的地方注明联系方式和求职意向。 接下来算是简历的正文。所有的简历都把教育经历放在首位。看来教育背景还是对方关注的首要问题。教育背景是按照时间倒序排列的，最近的放在最上面。有的是时间写在前面，紧跟学校、专业作为条目的标题，或者把学校、专业放前面，后面跟时间。标题下面是具体的介绍。 然后是工作经历，格式和教育背景基本一致。某些简历在教育背景和工作经历之间还加上了学过的和专业相关的课程，培训班等。而在工经理后面还可以加上参加过的志愿者工作等。 以上是简历中的重头戏。接下来的内容大多是自己掌握的技能，语言能力和计算机能力。有时还有个人爱好等更全面介绍自己的内容。 二、简历的用词翻译 下面列出一些中英文对照（有的地方可以用多个英文单词表示，用 \'|\' 隔开，这里列出的只是简历中出现的，也许并不仅限于这些）： 求职意向 ------- Objective Objective这个词在电脑游戏中出现的频率很高。一般是作为每关之前的任务介绍。直译就是目标、目的。如果有Objective，一般放在正文的第一栏。 教育背景 --------Education | Education and Qualifications 都用这个，background就不要加上了，有点中式英语的嫌疑。如果包含了一些认证培训之类的，可以写成 Education and Qualifications. 个人介绍、自我评价 -------- PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS | SYNOPSIS SYNOPSIS这个词比较笼统，内容可以自由些，包括个人性格，目前状况等。 PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS 偏重于介绍自己的优势、优点等。 工作经历 ---------- Experience | Work(ing) Experience | JOB EXPERIENCE | EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE 这些都是大同小异。也有个人用 EMPLOYMENT HIGHLIGHTS。 我注意到有个人在Work Experience 的位置用了 Research Experience， 再细看内容才发现此人的经历都是研究性质的工作，包括在大学期间从事的一些研究。 参加过的活动（包括校内） -------------- ACTIVITIES ACTIVITIES最普遍，所有的活动都包括了，比较好用。 Campus Involvement & Activities 这里加上compus 那就仅限于在学校的。这里的 Involvement 我猜想指的是参加社团或者某个组织的这种长期的活动。而Activities则不限。 荣誉、奖励 -------- Honors | Awards 有些干脆就用 Honors & Awards 剩下的一些 技能 ---- Skills | Additional Skills 爱好 ----- HOBBIES 计算机技能 ------ Computer Skills 也可以作为Skills的一部分。 志愿者经历 ----- VOLUNTEERING 接下来介绍一下具体内容的翻译。 流利使用某种语言： Fluent in XXX 普通话： Mandarin Chinese 熟悉......：Familiar with.... 精通.... ：proficient with | Advanced Skills in.... | Advanced Software User： （列出精通使用的软件名称） 个人、人： individual （注意不要用person什么的） 关于语言能力的： Daily Spoken （经常使用的）， Training Obtained（受过培训的---我想不仅限于语言能力）\n\n\n# 三、总结\n\n这些简历给我的最大感受是，简练。没有废话，有些地方甚至省略掉主语例如： Activities: President of College Democrats，中文简历中一般会说“曾担任校学生会主席”，而你要死板的翻译成英文就很罗嗦：“ I\'ve been the President of the Students\' Union of the college” ，不如就说 “President of the Students\' Union ”，能简单尽量简单，至于是校学生会，还是系学生会不必在乎，再说真的在乎的话面试的时候有机会的。而且语言简练不容易出错，何乐而不为。 在碰到一些不太好翻译的词汇时，不用着急，可以自己创造，只要能正确表达出中文词汇的含义即可。毕竟两种语言之间不是映射表的关系。 我看到一份简历在Education后面还加上了，Double Majors 和 Higher Level Course Work， 这样把突出的教育经历或者工作经历单独列出来，容易引起关注，是个好方法。 总之，要做到简练，结构清楚，表达明确，不出现错误，就是一个合格的英文简历。\n\n\n# 英文求职信七步写作法\n\n求职信分为推荐信和自荐信两种，它是书面表达的重要体裁之一，也是高考书面表达的热点内容。写求职信可按下列七个步骤进行。下面举例说明： 假设你叫李平，你从报上得知某公司欲招聘一名英语翻译，请你给该公司经理写一份求职信，你的个人资料如下： 1.简况：姓名，李平；年龄，30岁；身高，1.80米；健康状况，良好；业余爱好，游泳、唱歌、跳舞。 2.简历：1994年北京大学毕业后分配到南通中学工作，1996年调至苏州中学工作至今。 3.工作：工作认真负责，与人相处融洽。 4.特长：精通英语，尤其口语，已将多本中文书籍译成英语，懂一些日语、能用日语与外宾对话。 联系电话：3654 7557 联系地址：苏州市人民路75号\n\n\n# 第一步：介绍消息来源\n\n介绍消息来源实际上是求职信的开篇交待句，它可使求职信显得自然、顺畅；而不介绍消息来源，会使收信人感到意外、突然，文章也缺乏过渡、照应，本文消息来源可作如下介绍： Dear manager, I learned from the newspaper that your company wanted to hire an English translator.\n\n\n# 第二步：表明求职心愿\n\n介绍完消息来源后，应向收信人表明自己的求职心愿，即写信的目的，本文求职心愿可作如下介绍： I\'m interested in this job very much. I\'d like to get this job.\n\n\n# 第三步：介绍个人简历\n\n某单位需要新人，求职人也有求职心愿，但这并不意味着这项工作非你莫属。如果你没有干好这项工作的经历、实力，也是难以适应的。因此，介绍个人简历是必不可少的。本文个人简历可介绍如下： Now I\'d like to introduce myself to you. My name is Li Ping. I\'m 30 years old. I\'m 180 cm tall. I\'m healthy. I like swimming, singing and dancing in my spare time. I graduated from Beijing University in 1994.Then,I went to work in Nantong Middle School.In 1996，I began to work in Suzhou Middle School and I have worked there until now.\n\n\n# 第四步：摆出求职优势\n\n仅有一定的工作经历而没有自身的优势和特长，也很难求得称心如意的工作。因此，求职时应表明自己除了具有一定的工作经历之外，还具有一定的优势和特长，这样才能稳操胜券。本文可通过如下方法摆出自己的优势： I work hard and I can get along well with others. I\'m good at English and especially my spoken English is very good. I\'ve translated many Chinese books into English. I can understand Japanese and I can talk to foreigners in Japanese freely.\n\n\n# 第五步：提出获职打算\n\n丰富的工作经验，一定的优势和特长，只能代表过去和现在的情况，如果获职后自以为心愿已了，从此高枕无忧，马虎从事，那也是得不到用人单位认可的。显然表明获职后努力工作的决心是感动用人单位的领导从而顺利谋得此项工作的重要一环。本文获职打算可作如下介绍： If you agree with me, I\'ll work hard and try to be a good translator.\n\n\n# 第六步：请求答复联系\n\n如果单位领导同意了你的求职要求，你必然要请他和你联系，以便你及时做好准备，到用人单位应聘或报到。为准确起见，请求答复联系时你还应当提供你的通讯地址、邮政编码、电话号码、电子信箱等。本文答复联系的内容可作如下介绍： If you agree with me, please write a letter to me or phone me. I live at No.1 Renmin Road,Suzhou city. My telephone number is 365437###\n\n\n# 第七步：表明感激之情\n\n无论你的请求是否能够得到满意的答复，你给用人单位写信就是给对方添了麻烦，因此你应向对方表明感激之情。本文可这样来表明感激之情： Thank you very much. 上述七步内容联成一个整体，再加上下面的信尾，就成为一封完整的求职信。 Yours Truly LiPing\n\n下面一些英文面试经常问的问题:\n\nQ： Can you sell yourself in two minutes？ Go for it.\n\n你能在两分钟内自我推荐吗？大胆试试吧！\n\nA： With my qualifications and experience， I feel I am hardworking， responsible and diligent in any project I undertake.

(though avoid being seen as insincere) 提示:谈谈跟你工作相关的优势和不相关的缺点。如果可以的话，提出看起来像职业优点的个人缺点；例如我是一个工作狂！（当然尽量不显得虚伪。） for example 例如：“我在做展示时候一般会紧张，但是通过展示我又会获得更多自信。”\n\n\n# 3. why did you leave your last job?\n\n（3）当被问及上一份工作的离职原因，怎么回答？ question: 提问：为什么放弃上一份岗位？ hint: don\'t lie and don\'t speak badly of your past employer 提示：不要说谎，不要说前一任老板的坏话\n\nfor example:\n\ni feel that there is no room for growth in my last job, and i need a more challenging position. 我觉得上一份工作没有上升的空间了，我需要一份更有挑战性的工作。\n\nor：\n\ni feel that i have already maximized my talents in my previous role. i am only 28 years old now and hope to take on more responsibilities and embrace more challenges. 我觉得我已经在我的上一份岗位上发挥了所有的才能，我现在只是28岁，希望自己能够承担更多的责任，接受更多挑战。\n\n\n# 4. what are your salary requirements?\n\n（4）当被问及期望薪资，怎么回答？ question: 提问：你对薪资的要求是怎么样的？ hint:state that although salary is not your primary consideration you do have to pay the bills. 提示：传达出“工资不是你 找工作 的第一标准，但是日子还是要过的”的意思即可。 for example “薪资水平不是我衡量一份工作的第一标准，但是我也是需要还各类账单的，所以任何合理的出价我都是会考虑的。” say you would be open to any reasonable offer and if pressed for a figure give a number that shows you have researched the local job market. 如果按照以上的回答了，对方还要求给出一个范围的话就提出一个跟当地此类工作水平的薪资水平。\n\n\n# 5. pay attention to the simple questions\n\n（5）当被问及看似与无关工作的细节，如兴趣爱好等，怎么回答？ sometimes an interview question might seem very simple but, don’t be deceived, there is always a reason for them asking that question. here is some questions & answers： 有时候一个 面试 问题看上去也许非常的简单，但是不要被蒙骗了。hr问你的任何问题都是有他的理由的，下面就是一些示例： q: if you had to compare yourself with any animal; which one would it be and why?

在面试的最后，你应该要问面试官一些重点问题，例如接下来的程序是怎样的。再如“多久会收到是否录用的决定”，这会给你自己一个时间范围 for example: yes - about your ethical policy, and your carbon footprint...i was wondering whether you are planning to reduce your carbon footprint and whether all your products are ethically sourced? 其他回答例如：是的，有关你们的伦理道德政策，还有你们的碳足迹，我在好奇你们是否会降低你们的碳排放量，是否你们的所有产品都是从伦理道德角度出发去寻找生产商的。\n\n\n# 7. tell me about yourself.\n\n答: i was born and raised in dalian, china. i attended the university of beijing and received my masters degree in economics. i have worked for 5 years as a financial consultant in beijing for various companies including rossi consultants, peoples insurance of china and pepsi. i enjoy playing soccer in my free time and traveling. 答: ive just graduated from the university of toronto with a degree in computers science. during the summers, i worked as a systems administrator for a small company to help pay for my education. 评语: 这个问题的目的是想大概地了解你，所以无需讲太多细节的东西。你的回答通常会帮助面试官决定下个问题问什么。除了给对方一个整体的印象，最重要的是着重讲和工作有关的经验。工作经验是大多数面试中最重要的环节，比学历更重要\n\n\n# 8. 问: what type of position are you looking for?\n\n答: im interested in an entry level (beginning) position. 答: im looking for a position in which i can utilize my experience. 答: i would like any position for which i qualify. 评语:对于一个英语非母语的申请人，许多公司期望你能从低做起，慢慢弥补语言方面的不足。就算你以前很成功有多年经验，也应当有这个心理准备。\n\n\n# 9.问: are you interested in a full-time or part-time position?\n\n英语面试问题及回答 答: i am more interested in a full-time position. however, i would also consider a part-time position. 评语: 尽量留最大的余地争取机会。因为只要工作拿到了，以后的事情就容易把握，主动性大多了。 10.问: can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job? 答: i advised customers on financial matters. after i consulted the customer, i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis. 评语: 提到过往工作经验时，注意越详细越好。新移民最容易犯的错误之一是讲过去经历时太过笼统。雇主是想知道你到底做什么以及你做得怎么样，你讲得越详细，他们就越能知道你是否在行。你可以换着用一些不同的词汇来形容，而且尽量不要每句话都用“i”开头。记得用过去时态。\n\n\n# 10. 问: what is your greatest strength?\n\n答: i work well under pressure. when there is a deadline (a time by which the work must be finished), i can focus on the task at hand (current project) and structure my work schedule well. i remember one week when i had to get 6 new customer reports out by friday at ## i finished all the reports ahead of time without having to work overtime. 答: i am an excellent communicator. people trust me and come to me for advice. one afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome (difficult) customer who felt he was not being served well. i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together. 答: i am a trouble shooter. when there was a problem at my last job, the manager would always ask me to solve it. last summer, the lan server at work crashed. the manager was desperate and called me in (requested my help) to get the lan back online. after taking a look at the daily backup, i detected the problem ahttp://www.wenku1.comnd the lan was up and running (working) within the hour. 评语: 不用谦虚，充满自信地把自己最好的方面都抖出来。记得要给一些具体的例子，举例时变化用词。\n\n\n# 12. 问: what is your greatest weakness?\n\n答: i am overzealous (work too hard) and become nervous when my co-workers are not pulling their weight (doing their job). however, i am aware of this problem, and before i say anything to anyone, i ask myself why the colleague is having difficulties. 答: i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisified. however, i began setting time-limits for myself if i noticed this happening. 评语: 这其实是一个很巧妙的问题，你要讲得出一个其实是优点的缺点。比如工作太认真啦，对自己对人要求很高啦，工作很追求完美啦，等等。在讲到缺点后要记得说你一直在致力于改善。\n\n\n# 13. 问:why do you want to work for us?\n\n答: after following your firms progress for the last 3 years, i am convinced that smith and sons are becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be part of the team. 答: i am impressed by the qualitiy of your products. i am sure that i would be a convincing salesman because i truly believe that the atomizer is the best product on the market today. 评语: 对这个问题你要事前做研究，通过看公司网站，其他有关信息等。越了解公司，对你越有利。\n\n\n# 14. 问: when can you begin?\n\n答: immediately. 答: as soon as you would like me to begin. 评语: 充分表示你想要工作!\n\n\n# 15. 对于英语非母语的人来说，最重要和最难的是用英语讲述大量细节，尤其是复杂的细节。\n\n然而，雇主是很有必要知道你能否把工作范畴内的细节表达清楚，这对你是否胜任至关重要。不要太过担心语法问题。只要用词够多，内容够细，只要不影响理解，语法往往不是那么重要。 面试时招聘人员总会问你："do you have any questions?"其中一忌就是用"nothing"来回答这个问题。问什么问题，对你的印象分有帮助，显示你是一个用心的人。一般来说，围绕着这些话题来问比较得体： the competitive environment in which the organization operates 公司营运所处的竞争环境 executive management styles 管理高层的风格 what obstacles the organization anticipates in meeting its goals 公司在达到其目标过程中预计会遇到什么障碍 how the organizations goals have changed over the past three to five years 公司的经营方向在过去三到五年内有什么变化 第一次面试，或者在双方未有确定的意向以前，除非是已经到了签offer的阶段，最好不要问待遇如何。那样显得你更关心公司能为你做什么，而不是你为公司能做什么。 具体来说，你可以问以下问题：\n\n 1. what are the main objectives and responsibilities of the position?\n 2. how does the company expect these objectives to be met?\n 3. what obstacles are commonly encountered in reaching these objectives?\n 4. what is the desired time frame for reaching the objectives?\n 5. what resources are available from the company and what must be found elsewhere to reach the objectives?\n\n\n# 16. 教育背景：\n\n简明扼要，实话实说尽管你在简历中对自己的教育背景作了介绍，但在面试时，面试官还有可能就此方面提问。还是事先做点准备吧。\n\n\n# ①i：what is your major?\n\na：my major is business administration. i am especially interested in“marketing”。 (不仅回答了问题，还顺带一句介绍了自己较为感兴趣的方面，简明扼要。)\n\n\n# ②i：which university are you attending?\n\na：i am attending×××university.\n\n\n# ③i：have you received any degrees?\n\na：yes. first， i received my bachelor degree in english literature， and then an mba degree. ④i：what course did you like best? a：project management. i was very interested in this course when i was a student. and i think it‘s very useful for my present work. ⑤i：do you feel that you have received a good general training? a：yes， i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university. i am currently studying finance at a training school.\n\n\n# 17. 工作经验：显露实力，避免炫耀\n\n①i：have you ever been employed? ②i：your resume says you have had one-year experience working in a foreign representative office in shanghai， may i ask why you left? a：i worked in a foreign rep.office for one year.however，i left there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull.i found another job that is more interesting. ③i：have you done any work in this field?

could you sell yourself within a few minutes? 这个问题可以说是大众问题了，通过这个问题，面试官一方面大致把握一下你的英语水平， 一方面找到和你交流的突破点，探寻本质，打破沙锅是人力资源经理的一惯作风， 因此回答这个问题时务必事实求是，否则后面很可能无法自圆其说。不过这个问题其实也不复杂， 外教william hill告诉我们说与其说这个是测试应聘者的问题，不如说是应聘者卖弄自己 英语的大好机会，so don\'t miss the boat！ 你可以从以下几个方面突出自己：职业技能强项，该技能的深入程度，该技能完成过的项目 以及自己其他相关方面的深入研究和学习、探索，注意突出个性。请不要在自己的姓名、年龄、 毕业学校、兴趣爱好等方面浪费时间，也不用再把你的简历背诵一遍，因为老外已经看过你的cv了。 时间可以根据情况控制在2-3分钟的样子。注意外企英语面试是口头表达的过程，建议在随后的互动 过程中多多使用口语化的表达，尽量让自己融入整个对话（conversation），而不是在教条式的背诵文章。 4、关于应聘动机的：why do you wanna work for us? what makes you come here today? 面试官想了解一下你的求职动机，看看你对公司是否有所了解。显然这个功课是你来面试之前 就应该做好的，所以千万别说开始面试了还不知道这个公司是做什么的。请在回答这个问题的 时候充满信心，不要说是来试试的（you really wanna take a try?），如果能事先将公司信息整理 好并梳理一下和自己的职业技能相结合来介绍，则可谓perfect response。 5、关于你的弱点：what do you think is your greatest weakness? may i know it? 注意后面那句是客气的，千万别说no，也别说"i don\'t think i have any weakness"。 客观地评价一下自己确实存在但对工作并不重要的缺点是一个不错的办法，当然别忘了 要提一下你将采取什么样的办法来克服或弥补自己的缺点。 6、关于你过去的工作：how do you like your last job? why did ya leave your last job? 面试官想通过你对过去的工作的看法，了解你对今后的工作态度。如果你说你不喜欢你过去的 工作，那么你将面临“既然不喜欢为什么却会选择”这样的难题，最终结果是“缺乏判断力或者没有主见”。 事实上你既然做过以前的工作，那么应该多少还是比较喜欢的，不妨谈谈过去的工作特点和你所负责 的主要任务，但要突出过去的工作趋于平淡且失去挑战性，你可以在更艰巨的任务和岗位中发挥能力。 同时面试官极有可能问你以前的同事和上司的一些问题，切记不要把责任归咎到别人身上。 7、关于你将来的打算：how long do you propose to work here? 这个问题对职场老手来说简直就是a piece of cake。简洁的几句话表达出你希望在这个公司一直 工作下去即可，同时要体现出你的上进心，渴望与公司一起发展和进步，不断提升自己。 8、反问的机会：ok, now if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. “nope, i have none, thanks!”这样的回答就完全错了。抓住这个机会，把事先准备好的问题 和盘托出，多了解一些关于公司发展、职位要求、员工培训、员工晋升、员工福利等方面的问题。 其实外企英语面试并没有什么特别之处，话题内容上也跳不出中文面试的框框，无非是用英语来 表达而已。在某些特定职位的招聘上，可能外企更看重的是个人的职业能力而对英语表达要求甚低； 或者在某些特定的条件下没有太多的竞争者，应聘者不需要具备非常好的英语听说能力就可拿到offer。 但这些情况并不影响我们对自身竞争力的提升，卓越的英语听说能力必将为你的职场生涯带来裨益。 一些可能用得上的俚语表达： 注意: 1、up to par 达到标准。 2、i won\'t let the cat out of the bag. 我会严守秘密。 3、get on the ball 开始（做事） 4、a piece of cake 形容非常容易 5、face the music 勇于承担责任\n\n\n# what is important to you in a job?\n\nmention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, t he feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.\n\n\n# why do you want to work for this organization?\n\ncite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working condit ions. stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organ ization.\n\n\n# why should we employ you?\n\npoint to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm. mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. if the job involves management responsibilities, refer to past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team.\n\n\n# if we hire you, how long will you stay with us?\n\nanswer by saying along these lines: "as long as my position here allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities."\n\n\n# can we offer you a career path?\n\nreply: "i believe you could, once i know the normal progression within the organization. can you tell me about it?" the answer may be revealing.\n\n\n# what are your greatest strengths?\n\ngive a response like one of the following: "i can see what needs to be done and do it", "i\'m wiling to make decisions", "i work well with others," " i can organize my time efficiently."\n\n\n# what are you greatest weakness?\n\nidentify one or two, such as the following:" i tend to drive myself too hard", " i expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " i like to se e a job done quickly, and i\'m critical if it isn\'t." note these weaknesses c ould also be regarded as desirable qualities. the trick with this question i s to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.\n\n\n# what didn\'t you like about previous jobs you\'ve held?\n\ndiscuss the things you didn\'t like, but avoid making slighting reference to any of your former employers.\n\n\n# how do you spend your leisure time?\n\nmention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.\n\n\n# are there any weaknesses in your education or experience?\n\ntake stock of your weaknesses before the interview. practice discussing them in a positive light. you\'ll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer.\n\n1## where do you want to be five years from now?

they’d be lucky to have you!\n\n准备好你要提出的问题 在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先， 不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。 这里有风个备选问题： 请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会 参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？\n\n考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。 have questions of your own. toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” do you have any questions for me? you must have questions. first, don’t rush into your answer. look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. here is a handful of potential questions:\n\nhow would you describe a typical workday?/what is the best part of working at this company for you? are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/why did you join the company? interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.\n\n常见问题做好准备\n\n针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案： 谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？ / 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历 和大学活动与这份工作有何关联?\n\n最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职， 参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要 把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。 have answers ready for these popular interview questions:\n\ntell me a little about yourself./what interests you most about this position?/where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/what is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./what are your greatest strengths?/what did you like about your last job?/what separates you from other candidates?/how do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work?\n\nmost importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)the problem you encountered, 2)how you analyzed it, and 3)the solution you implemented.\n\n面试中的“陷阱”问题\n\n序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后 心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”， 那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。 第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的 缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么， 都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性 特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。 如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多 份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢： “我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。”\n\nthe best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. if interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. but if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“hey, i enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.\n\nfirst is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. the trap question is some variaton on“ what is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ what is your area of weakness?” the real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. for example: “i prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. i sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ sometimes i have a hard time saying no to people, and i end up taking on more than my share of work.” if you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “i’m a perfectionist. i need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure i get everything right. ”\n\n为何要离开你以前的公司\n\n对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题 （以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位 上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境 不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。 be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. these questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“it was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.\n\n面试难题的应答策略 （上） 求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。 一、你来这里能干什么？ 对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略： 1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。 2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。 3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。 4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。 5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。 二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？\n\n用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略： 1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。 所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因： （a）专业对口； （b）公司有发展； （c）工作环境优越； （d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"； （e）有更多到外国工作的机会； （f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣； （g）离家近； （h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染） 2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。 3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。\n\n面试难题的应答策略 （下） 三、你自认为有什么优缺点？ 主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人， 往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出， 那就不适合做某项工作。 答问策略： 1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这 类问题就不知如何是好了。 2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个 缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。 3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。 4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有， 又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己： 对应聘有利的优点： --好学习、肯钻研。 --脑子好使，记忆力强。 --办事认真，一丝不苟。 --有干劲，不惜力。 --好相处，跟谁都合得来。 --有比较丰富的阅历。 --喜欢接受挑战性的课题。 --不交女友（男友）不成家。 对应聘有利的缺点： --有名利思想： （a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。 （b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。 （c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待， 克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。） --急脾气 （a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。 （b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。 （c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！ --有时主观： （a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。 （b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。 （c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。 --不拘小节： （a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。 （b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。 （c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。） --抠门儿、吝啬： （a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。 （b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！ （该人适合管理财务工作）。 （c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。 --害羞、胆小： （a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。 （该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作） （b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。 （c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。 有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。） --不顾家： （a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。 （b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。 "所以，我不是一个好丈夫。 （c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。 5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。 四、你善于与什么人相处? 主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事 沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、 促销等任务。答问策略： 1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明 你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。 2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。 所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。 3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位， 就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。 4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。 五、你为什么经常想调动工作？ 主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因， 是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆 不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略： 1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。 2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有： （a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）； （b）跟原单位的领导不和； （c）想多挣钱； （d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。 3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）： （a）能实现个人的抱负； （b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展； （c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。\n\n这里只是几个常见的英文面试问题，以供参考，多见于外企 what are your weaknesses? this is the most dreaded question of all. handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “i am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. i recently joined toastmasters, which i find very helpful.”\n\nwhy should we hire you? summarize your experiences: “with five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, i could make a big difference in your company. i’m confident i would be a great addition to your team.”\n\nwhy do you want to work here? the interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. for example, “i’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where i know i could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.”\n\nwhat are your goals? sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. for example, “my immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. my long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. i hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.”\n\nwhy did you leave (are you leaving) your job? if you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “i managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.” if you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “after two years, i made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where i can add my experience.”\n\nwhen were you most satisfied in your job? the interviewer wants to know what motivates you. if you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “i was very satisfied in my last job, because i worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.”\n\nwhat can you do for us that other candidates can’t? what makes you unique? this will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. summarize concisely: “i have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. this allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102 rmation to be more user-friendly.”\n\nwhat are three positive things your last boss would say about you? it’s time to pull out your old per&＃102 rmance appraisals and boss’s quotes. this is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “my boss has told me that i am the best designer he has ever had. he knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.”\n\nwhat salary are you seeking? it is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. one possible answer would be: “i am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. in what range do you typically pay someone with my background?”\n\nif you were an animal, which one would you want to be? interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. if you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. if you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. what type of personality would it take to get the job done? what impression do you want to make?\n\n英语经典问答 interview english 想找一份满意的工作吗? 面试中面对外国老板连珠炮似的提问, 有没有觉得心慌意乱、无所适从？求职过程中 面试尤为重要，回答问题，如果能简明扼要，真诚中肯，合乎老外口味，那么录取机会必定大大增加。当然， 有的问题，也要轻描淡写，以免言多必失。本篇摘录了若干面试中出现频率较高的问题及精彩回答，希望 能在您求职路上助您一臂之力。\n\nother tips (其它建议) know something about the organization you are applying to.

你最希望从工作中得到什么? applicant: i hope to get a kind of learning, to get skills from my work. though i have studied in school for nearly 16 years, i have only learned knowledge. in the university, i got no chance to see real life and didn\'t get working skills. so i want to learn some working skills and become a professional in an industry. 我最希望得到的是一种学习，能让我学到工作的技能。虽然我已经在学校学习了快16年,但只是学习到了知识，在学校里，没有机会接触到真正的社会，没有掌握一项工作技能，所以我最希望获得一项工作的技能，能够成为某一个行业领域的专业人士。 interviewer: why did you choose us?

你最希望这份工作给予你什么? applicant: i hope this job will give me a chance to take responsibility. in more than ten years\' of study as a student, i have never taken any responsibility in any real sense or earned money for a company. i think people can only become mature by taking on responsibility. i hope this work will give me the chance to develop fully. 我希望这份工作可以给我一个承担职责的机会。在过去十几年的学习生涯中，作为一名学生，我从来没有在真正意义上承担过责任，为一个企业盈利。我认为，人是通过承担一定的责任才能成长、成熟的，我希望这份工作能够给予我发展的机会。 以上例子从学习和承担职责的角度出发，都十分注重能力的培养，这会让面试官觉得求职者不是一个功利心很强的人，给面试官留下好印象。 面试：如何应对角色扮演的问题 角色扮演是各大外企招聘时经常采用的方式之一。回答这类问题的要点是应聘者一定要设身处地、把自己当作角色中的人物。另外，基于任何角色提出的问题根本的目的是要考察应聘者对公司的态度，所以在角色扮演时，要把自己想象成该角色，也要站在全公司的角度来考虑问题，所谓大处着眼、小处着手，方能立于不败之地。 case one interviewer: you are a director of our company and you are in charge of a project. there are six people in the project team. due to different opinions, the team is split into two parts at a meeting and they are debating ferociously. at this time, as a leader, what will you do to coordinate the two parts? if the two parts disagree, what will you do then? 如果你已经成为我公司的一名主管，由你负责管理一个项目。在该项目的团队中一共有六个人。在一次会议上，由于观点不同，团队分成两派，,进行了激烈的争论，这时，你作为领导者该如何协调？如果两方不能达成共识，你又会怎么办？ applicant: first, i will listen to both sides carefully, and make my own judgment. if i prefer one side, i will give facts and data to persuade the other side. if my opinion is between the two sides, i will also give facts and data to prove my opinion right. it is better that the two sides will agree on it. if not, i will stick to my opinion and allow the colleagues who keep reserved opinions to give more data and communicate with me. in short, my principle is that everything should be based on data and facts. every colleague has the right to express his opinion. i will try my best to make all people agree on one thing. if i fail, i will make my decision, as a leader. 首先我会仔细聆听双方的观点和理由，并作出我的判断。如果我倾向于其中一方的观点，我会拿出数据和事实来说服另一方；如果我的观点是介于两者之间，我同样会基于数据和事实来证明我的立场。如果最后大家能够达成共识自然最好。如果不能，我会坚持我的观点，但允许持保留意见的同事拿出更多的数据来和我沟通。总之，我的原则是，用数据和事实说话，每一位同事都有权表达他的观点，我会尽量让大家达成共识。如果不行，那作为领导者，我会做出一个决定。 点评：该求职者能够基于数据和事实说话，既不是独断专行，也不做和事老，这充分表现了他处理问题的成熟程度。 case two interviewer: you are now a team member and if your leader has made a decision but you don\'t quite agree with this decision and other members don\'t express any special opinions, what will you do? 如果你现在是一个项目的团队成员，如果你的领导已经作出了一个决定，但你个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，那你会怎么做？ applicant: if my leader has made a decision, but i myself don\'t quite agree with this decision and other members don\'t express any special opinion, i will still express my opinion. if the leader doesn\'t agree with me, i will make my own judgment. if this decision isn\'t very important, then as a team member, i will act according to what the leader has decided. if this is a key decision, i will gather related information to support my view and try to persuade my leader. 如果我的领导已经做出了一个决定，但我个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，这时候问我仍然会提出我的意见。如果领导不同意，那我会做出自己的判断。如果我们这个决定并不是十分重要的，那么作为团队成员，我会遵照领导的决定来执行；如果是一个关键的决定，我会搜集相关的材料为我自己的观点寻找支持，力求说服领导。 点评：虽然只是一个团队成员，但该求职者仍然能够大胆地提出自己地意见，并且能够就问题做出理性的判断，能够让面试官觉得该求职者是真正站在公司的立场上看待问题，并且体现了他处理问题的成熟性。 －occupational experience experience in auditing, cost accounting and taxation.有审计、成本会计和税务方面的经验。 －working experience in foreign company.有在外资公司工作的经验者。 －five years\' experience in foreign trade or foreignowned venture.有5年在外贸方面或外资企业工作的经验。 －experience working with foreign companies.有在外国公司工作的经验。 －three years of experience in personnel recruiting. screening and interviewing.有3年的人员招募、选拔和面试方面的经验。 －some experience in product distribution.略具产品销售的经验。 －knowledge of u. s. specifications and standards.具有美国规格标准方面 知识。 －sales experience of medical equipment and working experience in radiology department is preferred．有医疗设备销售经验及在放射科工作的经验 。 －1 year working experience in commerce or consumer products.有1年在商 业或消费产品方面的工作经验者。 －international accounting and joint venture experience．有国际会计和合 资企业的工作经验。 　－have 2 year\'s，programming experience.有2年电脑编程的经验。 －5 years\' experience in staff management．有5年管理员工的经验。 －telecommunication services experience with china post and telecommunication bureaus．有在中国邮电局进行电信服务的经验。 －experience serving top-level managment。具备为高级管理人员服务的经验 。 －have one year experience in the same capacity with foreign company.有 1年在外资企业担任同样职务的经验。 －3 years maintenance supervisory experience in electricity wiring， mechanical engineering，etc.有3年在电线工程、机械工程等方面进行维修督导的 经验。 －experience in export business .有出口贸易的经验。 －has the experience in training and supervising production supervisors and technicians.有培训和督导生产管理人员和技术人员的经验。 －2 years factory management experience .有2年工厂管理的经验。 －experience working in multinational environment.有在多国环境下的工作 经验。 －4 years\' relevant experience.有4年相关经验者优先。 －2 years\'secretarial experience．有2年的文秘经验。 －familiarity with international trade issues.熟悉国际贸易问题。 －have experience in the computerization of financial functions．有财务 电算化的经验。 －three years\' experience in teaching english as a second language．有 年将英语作为第二语言的英语教学经验。 －experience in marketing research＆analysis．有市场营销研究和分析的经 验。 －working experience in advertising.有广告方面的工作经验。 －have experience as a receptionist．有当接待员的经验。 －experience in building construction or steel industry.有建筑和钢铁工 业的经验。 －substantial experience in selling technical／chemical items.有销售技 术、化学品的丰富经验。 －5 years working experience and familiar with office equipment and electronic products design，understanding the u. s. a.＆asia market.有5年工作经验并熟悉办公室设备及电子产品设计且了解美国与亚洲市场。 －experience in project, sales and service coordination．有策划、销售和 售后服务协调的经验。 －have 2 years experience in either media planning and account servicing on international clients．有2年媒介策划及对国际客户进行业务服务 的经验。 －3 years relevant marketing experience in advertising and promotion.有3年在广告和推销方面的相关业务经验。\n\n求职面试时的"甜言蜜语"\n\n\n# what is important to you in a job?\n\nchallenge, the feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.\n\n\n# why do you want to work for this organization?\n\nits reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working conditions.\n\n\n# why should we employ you?

sheet： 基本方法选取适当的工作后，必须看清招聘广告上所列出的每项要求，再将自己的学历、能力与兴趣逐一与之比较，作一张balance sheet. 例如，一则关于marketing management trainee和job requirement是这样写的： we are looking for a competent person to fill the captioned position： university graduate majors in marketing management. prepared to develop career in the commercial field -outgoing personality -able to communicate with different levels -good knowledge in pc operations -proficiency in written and spoken english/mandarin 则你相应地考虑自己的qualification的选择和表述，如你可写（与上列各项对应）： -university graduate with major in marketing -having actively participated in business club‘s activities and learned accounting and management -good in communication with people and like a lot of out door activities know how to tackle with people from all walks of life -skillful in operating words,excel,lotus1-2-3,etc -fluent in english and studied advanced level of mandarin 这个方法的好处是可让求职者清楚了解该职位是否适合自己，而本身资料又是否切合要求，而且，明白了各项要求后，就可依据每一点在履历表上重点提出自己在该方面的强项。突出卖点(selling point)，将之放在最吸引别人的地方，使招聘者一眼可见，有利于present自己。 工作经验的陈述 工作经验是一份resume中令招聘者相当感兴趣的一项内容，善加措词是必不可忽视的要务。 刚毕业，何来工作经验？其实，客下读书时的兼职、实习、实践，以至所曾参加的一些课外活动－协助助出版学校刊物、举办活动，展览、宣传……都可算是工作经验、不过，表达起来要有针对性地展开，列出那些与所找工作有关连的项目重点介绍，必要时更可使用summary的方式，给招聘者深入的了解。 下面这份材料的相关表这实在简陋呆板： 1996/7-1996/8 general clerk, ibm 1995/7-1995/8 account clerks, manley toy trading 1994/6-1994/8salesgirl,esprit. 倘能换一种表述如： three years of job experience in different positions have offered me opportunities to understand different job aspects. -as a general clerk(ibm),accounts clerk (manley toy trading),i have learned how to prepare purchasing orders, place orders, handle accounting mattery, check voucher,……also(salesgirl, esprin)developing the technique of sellina, serving and stocking. 岂非能更好地突出个人工作经验，吸引招聘者的注意力！ job objective通常，一般求者只会在履历表开端简单地写上所应征的职位－"position applied: management trainee"或"i am appling for……"其实，若懂得利用这小小空间写出自己的事业目标（job objective），能显示出你对该工作的热诚及憧憬，能令招聘者对你加倍留意。 比如这个不错的例子job objective to begin as a marketing management trainee, with opportunity to advance to executive level and contribute to the development of firm. 其实，这位外企人士所谈的关于准备resume的技巧，完全可以应用到中文简历上来。各位读者可以尝试一下。\n\n求职面试的技巧 tricks in job hunting interview here are good answers to some of the tougher questions asked in job interviews. if you can smoothly supply answers like these during the interview, you are bound to make a good impression.\n\n\n# what is important to you in a job?\n\nmention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, the feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.\n\n\n# why do you want to work for this organization?\n\ncite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working conditions. stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organization.\n\n\n# why should we employ you?\n\npoint to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm. mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. if the job involves management responsibilities, refer to past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team.\n\n\n# if we hire you, how long will you stay with us?\n\nanswer by saying along these lines: "as long as my position here allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities."\n\n\n# can we offer you a career path?\n\nreply: "i believe you could, once i know the normal progression within the organization. can you tell me about it?" the answer may be revealing.\n\n\n# what are your greatest strengths?\n\ngive a response like one of the following: "i can see what needs to be done and do it", "i\'m wiling to make decisions", "i work well with others," "i can organize my time efficiently."\n\n\n# what are you greatest weakness?\n\nidentify one or two, such as the following:" i tend to drive myself too hard", " i expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " i like to see a job done quickly, and i\'m critical if it isn\'t." note these weaknesses could also be regarded as desirable qualities. the trick with this question is to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.\n\n\n# what didn\'t you like about previous jobs you\'ve held?\n\ndiscuss the things you didn\'t like, but avoid making slighting reference to any of your former employers.\n\n\n# how do you spend your leisure time?\n\nmention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.\n\n\n# are there any weaknesses in your education or experience?\n\ntake stock of your weaknesses before the interview. practice discussing them in a positive light. you\'ll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer. where do you want to be five years from now? saying that you\'d like to be president is unrealistic, yet few employers want people who are content to sit still. you might say, "in five years, i\'d like to have my boss\'s job. " if you can\'t qualify for your boss\'s job by then, you may not be the fright candidate.\n\n\n# what are your salary expectations?\n\nif you are asked this at the outset, it\'s best to say, "why don\'t we discuss salary after you decide whether i\'m right for the job? "but if the interviewer asks this after showing real interest in you, speak up. she or he will probably try to meet your price. if you need a clue about what to ask for, say, " can you discuss your salary range with me?" 1### what would you do if....? this question is designed to test your reposes. for example: "what would you do if your computer broke down during an audit?" your answer there isn\'t nearly so important as your approach to the problem. and a calm approach is best. start by saying, "one thing i might do is ..." then give several alternative choices. 1### what type of position are you interested in? job titles and responsibilities vary from firm to firm . so state your skills instead, such as "i\'m good at figure work," and the positions that require these skills , such as "accounts payable." 1### tell me something about yourself. say you\'ll be happy to talk about yourself, and ask what the interviewer wants to know. if this point is clarified, respond. if not, tell why you feel your skills will contribute to the job and the organization. this question gives you a great opportunity to sell yourself. 1### do you have any questions about the organization or the job? employers like a candidate who is interested in the organization. so this is a perfect time to convey your interest and enthusiasm.\n\n面试的最后需要做些什么? 关于真正的面试最后要提醒的是：结束面试时要说：“我对这份工作非常感兴趣，我下一步要干些什么？”朋友，你是否在热切地盼望着？如果聘用你，那将是他们的幸运！ one last great tip about the actual interview: always end the interview with, “i am very interested in the position. what are the next steps to take?” boy, are you eager? they’d be lucky to have you! 准备好你要提出的问题 在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先，不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。这里有风个备选问题： 请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？ 考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。 have questions of your own. toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” do you have any questions for me? you must have questions. first, don’t rush into your answer. look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. here is a handful of potential questions: how would you describe a typical workday?/what is the best part of working at this company for you? /are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/why did you join the company? interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.\n\n常见问题做好准备 针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案： 谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？/ 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历和大学活动与这份工作有何关联? 最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职，参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。 have answers ready for these popular interview questions: tell me a little about yourself./what interests you most about this position?/where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/what is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./what are your greatest strengths?/what did you like about your last job?/what separates you from other candidates?/how do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work? most importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)the problem you encountered,2)how you analyzed it, and 3)the solution you implemented.\n\n面试中的“陷阱”问题 序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”，那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。 第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么，都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢：“我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。” the best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. if interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. but if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“hey, i enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.\n\nfirst is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. the trap question is some variaton on“ what is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ what is your area of weakness?” the real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. for example: “i prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. i sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ sometimes i have a hard time saying no to people, and i end up taking on more than my share of work.” if you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “i’m a perfectionist. i need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure i get everything right. ”\n\n为何要离开你以前的公司 对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题（以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。 be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. these questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“it was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.\n\n面试难题的应答策略 求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。 一、你来这里能干什么？ 对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略： 1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。 2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。 3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。 4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。 5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。 二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？ 用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略： 1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因： （a）专业对口； （b）公司有发展； （c）工作环境优越； （d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"； （e）有更多到外国工作的机会； （f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣； （g）离家近； （h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染） 2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。 3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。\n\n面试难题的应答策略 （下） 三、你自认为有什么优缺点？ 主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人，往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出，那就不适合做某项工作。 答问策略： 1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这类问题就不知如何是好了。 2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。 3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。 4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有，又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己： 对应聘有利的优点： --好学习、肯钻研。 --脑子好使，记忆力强。 --办事认真，一丝不苟。 --有干劲，不惜力。 --好相处，跟谁都合得来。 --有比较丰富的阅历。 --喜欢接受挑战性的课题。 --不交女友（男友）不成家。 对应聘有利的缺点： --有名利思想： （a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。 （b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。 （c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待，克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。） --急脾气 （a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。 （b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。 （c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！ --有时主观： （a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。 （b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。 （c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。 --不拘小节： （a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。 （b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。 （c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。） --抠门儿、吝啬： （a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。 （b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！（该人适合管理财务工作）。 （c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。 --害羞、胆小： （a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。（该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作） （b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。 （c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。） --不顾家： （a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。 （b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。"所以，我不是一个好丈夫。 （c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。 5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。 四、你善于与什么人相处? 主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、促销等任务。答问策略： 1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。 2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。 3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位，就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。 4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。 五、你为什么经常想调动工作？ 主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因，是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略： 1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。 2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有： （a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）； （b）跟原单位的领导不和； （c）想多挣钱； （d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。 3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）： （a）能实现个人的抱负； （b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展； （c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。\n\n常见的英文面试问题，多见于外企 what are your weaknesses? this is the most dreaded question of all. handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “i am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. i recently joined toastmasters, which i find very helpful.” why should we hire you? summarize your experiences: “with five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, i could make a big difference in your company. i’m confident i would be a great addition to your team.” why do you want to work here? the interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. for example, “i’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where i know i could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.” what are your goals? sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. for example, “my immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. my long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. i hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.” why did you leave (are you leaving) your job? if you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “i managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.” if you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “after two years, i made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where i can add my experience.” when were you most satisfied in your job? the interviewer wants to know what motivates you. if you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “i was very satisfied in my last job, because i worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.” what can you do for us that other candidates can’t? what makes you unique? this will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. summarize concisely: “i have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. this allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102;ormation to be more user-friendly.” what are three positive things your last boss would say about you? it’s time to pull out your old per&＃102;ormance appraisals and boss’s quotes. this is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “my boss has told me that i am the best designer he has ever had. he knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.” what salary are you seeking? it is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. one possible answer would be: “i am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. in what range do you typically pay someone with my background?” if you were an animal, which one would you want to be? interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. if you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. if you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. what type of personality would it take to get the job done? what impression do you want to make?\n\n英文简历攻略 经常看到有人发翻译简历的贴子。其实我个人认为简历的翻译并没有定式，可自由发挥。但是有一个原则关系到别人看了你的英文简历后对你的英文水平的第一印象，那就是简历中地用词，句子，表达方式等一定要地道。也就是说不能带有太多的所谓中式英语，让别人一看就觉得很不爽。最近我有幸得到一些老外（包括非英语国家）的简历，看了以后颇有收获，拿来共享心得。题目虽然是《完全攻略》，但时间仓促，难免有理解错误，或者不完整的地方还希望大家指正，补充。总的来说，看完这些英文简历给我的感觉是：与其把中文简历翻译成英文，还不如用英文再写一个简历。这样完全按照英文的思维方式和习惯作为出发点写出的简历才会更地道。 一、简历的结构 首先，整个简历要分成若干部分：基本情况、自我介绍、教育经历、工作经历等等。这些部分如何分完全凭自己掌握。但是有些不内容是必不可少的。下面就列出我在这些简历上看到的栏目： 我注意到大部分简历的最上方（标题的位置）都是求职者的姓名和联系方式。也有某些简历用名字作为标题，然后下面的位置写上了自己的求职意向或者联系方式。而有些则是把联系方式做成页眉的效果。和这种方式能让阅读者对此人的姓名联系方式和求职意向一目了然，可以提高效率，并且对求职者有比较深刻的印象。由此可见她们的共同点是：大多以姓名作为大标题，然后再显眼的地方注明联系方式和求职意向。 接下来算是简历的正文。所有的简历都把教育经历放在首位。看来教育背景还是对方关注的首要问题。教育背景是按照时间倒序排列的，最近的放在最上面。有的是时间写在前面，紧跟学校、专业作为条目的标题，或者把学校、专业放前面，后面跟时间。标题下面是具体的介绍。 然后是工作经历，格式和教育背景基本一致。某些简历在教育背景和工作经历之间还加上了学过的和专业相关的课程，培训班等。而在工经理后面还可以加上参加过的志愿者工作等。 以上是简历中的重头戏。接下来的内容大多是自己掌握的技能，语言能力和计算机能力。有时还有个人爱好等更全面介绍自己的内容。 二、简历的用词翻译 下面列出一些中英文对照（有的地方可以用多个英文单词表示，用 \'|\' 隔开，这里列出的只是简历中出现的，也许并不仅限于这些）： 求职意向 ------- objective objective这个词在电脑游戏中出现的频率很高。一般是作为每关之前的任务介绍。直译就是目标、目的。如果有objective，一般放在正文的第一栏。 教育背景 --------education | education and qualifications 都用这个，background就不要加上了，有点中式英语的嫌疑。如果包含了一些认证培训之类的，可以写成 education and qualifications. 个人介绍、自我评价 -------- personality highlights | synopsis synopsis这个词比较笼统，内容可以自由些，包括个人性格，目前状况等。 personality highlights 偏重于介绍自己的优势、优点等。 工作经历 ---------- experience | work(ing) experience | job experience | employment experience 这些都是大同小异。也有个人用 employment highlights。 我注意到有个人在work experience 的位置用了 research experience， 再细看内容才发现此人的经历都是研究性质的工作，包括在大学期间从事的一些研究。 参加过的活动（包括校内） -------------- activities activities最普遍，所有的活动都包括了，比较好用。 campus involvement & activities 这里加上compus 那就仅限于在学校的。这里的 involvement 我猜想指的是参加社团或者某个组织的这种长期的活动。而activities则不限。 荣誉、奖励 -------- honors | awards 有些干脆就用 honors & awards 剩下的一些 技能 ---- skills | additional skills 爱好 ----- hobbies 计算机技能 ------ computer skills 也可以作为skills的一部分。 志愿者经历 ----- volunteering 接下来介绍一下具体内容的翻译。 流利使用某种语言： fluent in xxx 普通话： mandarin chinese 熟悉......：familiar with.... 精通.... ：proficient with | advanced skills in.... | advanced software user： （列出精通使用的软件名称） 个人、人： individual （注意不要用person什么的） 关于语言能力的： daily spoken （经常使用的）， training obtained（受过培训的---我想不仅限于语言能力）\n\n\n# 三、总结\n\n这些简历给我的最大感受是，简练。没有废话，有些地方甚至省略掉主语例如： activities: president of college democrats，中文简历中一般会说“曾担任校学生会主席”，而你要死板的翻译成英文就很罗嗦：“ i\'ve been the president of the students\' union of the college” ，不如就说 “president of the students\' union ”，能简单尽量简单，至于是校学生会，还是系学生会不必在乎，再说真的在乎的话面试的时候有机会的。而且语言简练不容易出错，何乐而不为。 在碰到一些不太好翻译的词汇时，不用着急，可以自己创造，只要能正确表达出中文词汇的含义即可。毕竟两种语言之间不是映射表的关系。 我看到一份简历在education后面还加上了，double majors 和 higher level course work， 这样把突出的教育经历或者工作经历单独列出来，容易引起关注，是个好方法。 总之，要做到简练，结构清楚，表达明确，不出现错误，就是一个合格的英文简历。\n\n\n# 英文求职信七步写作法\n\n求职信分为推荐信和自荐信两种，它是书面表达的重要体裁之一，也是高考书面表达的热点内容。写求职信可按下列七个步骤进行。下面举例说明： 假设你叫李平，你从报上得知某公司欲招聘一名英语翻译，请你给该公司经理写一份求职信，你的个人资料如下： 1.简况：姓名，李平；年龄，30岁；身高，1.80米；健康状况，良好；业余爱好，游泳、唱歌、跳舞。 2.简历：1994年北京大学毕业后分配到南通中学工作，1996年调至苏州中学工作至今。 3.工作：工作认真负责，与人相处融洽。 4.特长：精通英语，尤其口语，已将多本中文书籍译成英语，懂一些日语、能用日语与外宾对话。 联系电话：3654 7557 联系地址：苏州市人民路75号\n\n\n# 第一步：介绍消息来源\n\n介绍消息来源实际上是求职信的开篇交待句，它可使求职信显得自然、顺畅；而不介绍消息来源，会使收信人感到意外、突然，文章也缺乏过渡、照应，本文消息来源可作如下介绍： dear manager, i learned from the newspaper that your company wanted to hire an english translator.\n\n\n# 第二步：表明求职心愿\n\n介绍完消息来源后，应向收信人表明自己的求职心愿，即写信的目的，本文求职心愿可作如下介绍： i\'m interested in this job very much. i\'d like to get this job.\n\n\n# 第三步：介绍个人简历\n\n某单位需要新人，求职人也有求职心愿，但这并不意味着这项工作非你莫属。如果你没有干好这项工作的经历、实力，也是难以适应的。因此，介绍个人简历是必不可少的。本文个人简历可介绍如下： now i\'d like to introduce myself to you. my name is li ping. i\'m 30 years old. i\'m 180 cm tall. i\'m healthy. i like swimming, singing and dancing in my spare time. i graduated from beijing university in 1994.then,i went to work in nantong middle school.in 1996，i began to work in suzhou middle school and i have worked there until now.\n\n\n# 第四步：摆出求职优势\n\n仅有一定的工作经历而没有自身的优势和特长，也很难求得称心如意的工作。因此，求职时应表明自己除了具有一定的工作经历之外，还具有一定的优势和特长，这样才能稳操胜券。本文可通过如下方法摆出自己的优势： i work hard and i can get along well with others. i\'m good at english and especially my spoken english is very good. i\'ve translated many chinese books into english. i can understand japanese and i can talk to foreigners in japanese freely.\n\n\n# 第五步：提出获职打算\n\n丰富的工作经验，一定的优势和特长，只能代表过去和现在的情况，如果获职后自以为心愿已了，从此高枕无忧，马虎从事，那也是得不到用人单位认可的。显然表明获职后努力工作的决心是感动用人单位的领导从而顺利谋得此项工作的重要一环。本文获职打算可作如下介绍： if you agree with me, i\'ll work hard and try to be a good translator.\n\n\n# 第六步：请求答复联系\n\n如果单位领导同意了你的求职要求，你必然要请他和你联系，以便你及时做好准备，到用人单位应聘或报到。为准确起见，请求答复联系时你还应当提供你的通讯地址、邮政编码、电话号码、电子信箱等。本文答复联系的内容可作如下介绍： if you agree with me, please write a letter to me or phone me. i live at no.1 renmin road,suzhou city. my telephone number is 365437###\n\n\n# 第七步：表明感激之情\n\n无论你的请求是否能够得到满意的答复，你给用人单位写信就是给对方添了麻烦，因此你应向对方表明感激之情。本文可这样来表明感激之情： thank you very much. 上述七步内容联成一个整体，再加上下面的信尾，就成为一封完整的求职信。 yours truly liping\n\n下面一些英文面试经常问的问题:\n\nq： can you sell yourself in two minutes？ go for it.\n\n你能在两分钟内自我推荐吗？大胆试试吧！\n\na： with my qualifications and

iostream 头文件的一些主要特点和组件：\n\n 1. 标准流对象：\n    \n    * cin：标准输入流，通常用于从键盘读取输入。\n    * cout：标准输出流，用于向屏幕输出数据。\n    * cerr：标准错误流，用于输出错误消息到屏幕，不经过缓冲区，直接输出。\n    * clog：类似于 cerr，但输出通过缓冲区，用于输出日志信息。\n\n 2. 输入/输出操作符：\n    \n    * >>：从 cin 读取数据的提取操作符。\n    * <<：向 cout, cerr, 或 clog 写入数据的插入操作符。\n\n 3. 操纵符：用于改变流的格式或行为的函数，如 endl（用于插入换行符并刷新输出缓冲区）、std::setw（设置字段宽度）、std::setprecision（设置浮点数的精度）等。\n\n 4. 流状态标志：用于检查和设置流的状态（如错误状态）的功能。\n\niostream 头文件非常重要，因为它提供了与用户交互的基本机制。例如，它使得从标准输入读取数据以及将数据输出到标准输出成为可能，这对于控制台程序来说非常关键。\n\n一个基本的使用 iostream 的示例：\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n    cout << "Enter a number: ";\n    cin >> number;\n    cout << "You entered " << number << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n在这个程序中，我们使用 cin 来从用户那里接收一个数字，并使用 cout 来输出这个数字。endl 用于在输出的末尾添加一个换行符，并刷新输出缓冲区，确保立即显示输出。\n\n\n# include<vector>动态数组\n\n在C++标准模板库（STL）中，<vector> 头文件提供了 std::vector 类，这是一个动态数组的实现。std::vector 是一种序列容器，它可以存储具有相同类型的元素，并支持随机访问。\n\n以下是 std::vector 的一些主要特点：\n\n 1. 动态数组：vector 的大小可以在运行时动态改变。它可以根据需要自动扩容和缩容。\n\n 2. 连续存储：vector 中的元素是在连续的内存空间中存储的，这意味着它支持快速的随机访问。\n\n 3. 操作：\n    \n    * push_back：在 vector 的末尾添加一个元素。\n    * pop_back：移除 vector 末尾的元素。\n    * insert：在指定位置插入一个或多个元素。\n    * erase：删除指定位置或范围内的元素。\n    * clear：移除所有元素，使 vector 为空。\n    * size：返回 vector 中的元素数量。\n    * resize：改变 vector 的大小。\n    * [] 运算符和 at 方法：用于访问 vector 中的元素。\n\n 4. 性能特点：\n    \n    * 插入和删除操作在 vector 的末尾是高效的，但在中间或开始位置可能需要移动元素，因此可能较慢。\n    * 提供高效的随机访问，即直接访问任何位置的元素。\n    * 当 vector 的容量不足以容纳更多元素时，会自动重新分配更大的内存空间来扩容，这个操作的时间复杂度是线性的。\n\n 5. 用途：适用于需要快速随机访问元素的场景，以及元素的添加和移除主要发生在序列的末尾。\n\n在使用 std::vector 时，你需要包含 <vector> 头文件。由于 vector 是模板类，你可以用它来存储任何类型的元素，例如 std::vector<int>、std::vector<std::string> 等。\n\nstd::vector 是最常用的 STL 容器之一，因为它提供了高度灵活的数据结构，同时具备数组的许多优点。在实际编程中，vector 通常是默认的序列容器选择，除非有特定的理由要求使用其他类型的容器。\n\n\n# include<deque>双端队列\n\ndeque 在C++标准模板库（STL）中的全称是 "Double-Ended Queue"，即双端队列。它是一种允许在容器两端（即头部和尾部）高效插入和删除元素的序列容器。\n\ndeque 的特点包括：\n\n * 提供对头部和尾部元素的快速访问。\n * 支持在头部和尾部高效地插入和删除元素。\n * 支持随机访问，即可以通过索引直接访问任何元素。\n * 内部实现通常比 vector 复杂，因此当只需要在尾部添加或删除元素时，vector 可能是更好的选择。\n\n由于 deque 提供了在两端操作的灵活性，它在需要这种特性的场景下非常有用，如在实现某些算法或数据结构（例如队列和广度优先搜索算法）时。\n\n\n# include<list>链表\n\n在C++标准模板库（STL）中，<list> 头文件提供了 std::list 容器类，这是一个双向链表的实现。std::list 允许快速的插入和删除操作，它主要用于那些需要频繁插入和删除元素，且不需要快速随机访问的场合。\n\n以下是 std::list 的一些主要特点：\n\n 1. 动态大小：与数组不同，list 的大小不是固定的，可以根据需要动态增长或缩减。\n\n 2. 非连续存储：list 中的元素不是连续存储的，而是通过指针链接在一起。这意味着它允许常数时间内的元素插入和删除，但不支持快速随机访问。\n\n 3. 双向迭代：list 提供双向迭代，你可以从头到尾或从尾到头遍历列表。\n\n 4. 操作：\n    \n    * push_front 和 push_back：在列表的前端或后端添加一个元素。\n    * pop_front 和 pop_back：从列表的前端或后端移除一个元素。\n    * insert：在指定位置插入一个或多个元素。\n    * erase：删除指定位置或范围内的元素。\n    * clear：移除所有元素，使列表为空。\n    * size：返回列表中的元素数量。\n    * sort：对列表元素进行排序。\n    * reverse：反转列表中元素的顺序。\n\n 5. 性能特点：\n    \n    * 插入和删除操作通常是常数时间复杂度，与列表的大小无关。\n    * 由于元素不是连续存储的，遍历 list 比遍历 vector 或数组要慢。\n    * 不支持通过索引直接访问元素。\n\n 6. 用途：适用于元素经常被插入或删除，且不需要快速随机访问的场景。\n\n在使用 std::list 时，你需要包含 <list> 头文件。由于 list 是模板类，你可以用它来存储任何类型的元素，例如 std::list<int>、std::list<std::string> 等。\n\n在选择容器类型时，了解不同容器的特点和适用场景非常重要。对于需要快速随机访问的场合，std::vector 或数组可能是更好的选择；而对于频繁的插入和删除操作，特别是在序列的两端，std::list 或 std::deque 更为合适。\n\n\n# 如何自己编写头文件\n\n头文件是可以自定义的，在C++中，头文件通常用于声明函数、类、模板和全局变量等，这样它们就可以在多个源文件中被重用。头文件有助于组织代码、提高可维护性，并促进模块化编程。\n\n创建头文件的基本步骤如下：\n\n\n# 1. 创建头文件\n\n创建一个扩展名为 .h 或 .hpp 的文件。例如，my_functions.h。\n\n\n# 2. 写入代码\n\n在头文件中，您可以包含如下内容：\n\n * 函数原型（声明）\n * 类定义\n * 模板定义\n * 全局变量的声明\n * 宏定义\n * 其他头文件的包含\n\n例如，一个简单的头文件可能包含一个函数的声明：\n\n// my_functions.h\n#ifndef MY_FUNCTIONS_H\n#define MY_FUNCTIONS_H\n\nvoid PrintHelloWorld();\n\n#endif // MY_FUNCTIONS_H\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n\n# 3. 使用头文件防护\n\n为了防止头文件内容在同一个编译单元中被包含（#include）多次，通常使用预处理指令 #ifndef、#define 和 #endif 来创建所谓的 "include guards"。在上面的例子中，MY_FUNCTIONS_H 就是一个守卫宏。\n\n\n# 4. 在源文件中包含头文件\n\n在您的 .cpp 源文件中，使用 #include "my_functions.h" 来包含并使用头文件中声明的内容。\n\n// main.cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include "my_functions.h"\n\nvoid PrintHelloWorld() {\n    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    PrintHelloWorld();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n在上面的例子中，PrintHelloWorld 函数在 my_functions.h 中声明，在 main.cpp 中定义，并在 main 函数中调用。\n\n\n# 5. 编译\n\n编译您的程序时，确保包含所有相关的 .cpp 文件。头文件本身不会被直接编译，但它们在预处理阶段被包含在源文件中。\n\n创建和使用自定义头文件是一种很好的实践，尤其是在较大的项目中，因为它有助于将声明和实现分离，使代码更清晰、更易于管理。\n\n\n# 6. 路径管理\n\n前面没有提到路径如何管理，这也是确保头文件起作用很重要的一步。\n\n在C++中，包含（或导入）头文件时，头文件的路径可以根据其相对于源文件的位置或是相对于编译器的搜索路径来指定。头文件的路径可以用双引号 "" 或尖括号 <> 来指定，两者在搜索路径上有所不同。\n\n# 使用双引号 ""\n\n当使用双引号包含头文件时，如 #include "my_header.h"，编译器首先在源文件的当前目录中查找头文件。如果在当前目录中没有找到，它将按照编译器的搜索路径继续查找。这通常用于你自己编写的头文件或者特定于项目的头文件。\n\n例如：\n\n#include "my_header.h"  // 查找当前目录下的my_header.h\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n# 使用尖括号 <>\n\n当使用尖括号包含头文件时，如 #include <iostream>，编译器直接在其标准库目录和其他配置的库目录中搜索头文件。这主要用于标准库头文件或第三方库头文件。\n\n例如：\n\n#include <iostream>  // 查找标准库中的iostream\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n# 指定头文件路径\n\n如果头文件不在当前目录或标准库路径中，你需要告诉编译器去哪里查找这些文件。这可以通过以下几种方式实现：\n\n 1. 使用相对路径： 如果头文件位于源文件所在目录的子目录中，可以使用相对路径。\n    \n    #include "subdir/my_header.h"  // 在子目录中查找\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. 使用绝对路径： 直接指定头文件的完整路径（不推荐，因为降低了代码的可移植性）。\n    \n    #include "/path/to/my_header.h"\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 3. 编译器的 include 路径： 在编译时，可以通过编译器的命令行选项指定额外的 include 路径。例如，对于 GCC 和 Clang，可以使用 -I 选项。\n    \n    g++ -I/path/to/headers my_program.cpp\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n    \n    这告诉编译器在 /path/to/headers 目录中也查找头文件。\n\n# 小提示\n\n保持项目的组织结构清晰，将头文件放在合适的目录中，可以避免很多关于路径的问题。对于较大的项目，通常有一个专门的目录（如 include）来存放所有头文件。',normalizedContent:'# include<iostream>\n\n这是最常用的头文件，在c++中，#include <iostream> 是一条预处理指令，用于包含标准库中的 iostream 头文件。iostream 是c++标准库的一部分，主要用于输入和输出操作。\n\n以下是 iostream 头文件的一些主要特点和组件：\n\n 1. 标准流对象：\n    \n    * cin：标准输入流，通常用于从键盘读取输入。\n    * cout：标准输出流，用于向屏幕输出数据。\n    * cerr：标准错误流，用于输出错误消息到屏幕，不经过缓冲区，直接输出。\n    *

"my_header.h"，编译器首先在源文件的当前目录中查找头文件。如果在当前目录中没有找到，它将按照编译器的搜索路径继续查找。这通常用于你自己编写的头文件或者特定于项目的头文件。\n\n例如：\n\n#include "my_header.h"  // 查找当前目录下的my_header.h\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n# 使用尖括号 <>\n\n当使用尖括号包含头文件时，如 #include <iostream>，编译器直接在其标准库目录和其他配置的库目录中搜索头文件。这主要用于标准库头文件或第三方库头文件。\n\n例如：\n\n#include <iostream>  // 查找标准库中的iostream\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n# 指定头文件路径\n\n如果头文件不在当前目录或标准库路径中，你需要告诉编译器去哪里查找这些文件。这可以通过以下几种方式实现：\n\n 1. 使用相对路径： 如果头文件位于源文件所在目录的子目录中，可以使用相对路径。\n    \n    #include "subdir/my_header.h"  // 在子目录中查找\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. 使用绝对路径： 直接指定头文件的完整路径（不推荐，因为降低了代码的可移植性）。\n    \n    #include "/path/to/my_header.h"\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 3. 编译器的 include 路径： 在编译时，可以通过编译器的命令行选项指定额外的 include 路径。例如，对于 gcc 和 clang，可以使用 -i 选项。\n    \n    g++ -i/path/to/headers my_program.cpp\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n    \n    这告诉编译器在 /path/to/headers 目录中也查找头文件。\n\n# 小提示\n\n保持项目的组织结构清晰，将头文件放在合适的目录中，可以避免很多关于路径的问题。对于较大的项目，通常有一个专门的目录（如 include）来存放所有头文件。',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2024/01/25  20:50:42",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1706187042e3},{title:"C++

若参与运算量的类型不同，则先转换成同一类型，然后进行运算。转换类型按以下几个顺序进行：\n\n 1. 转换按数据长度增加的方向进行，以保证精度不降低。如intint型和longlon**g型运算时，先把intint量转成longlon**g型后再进行运算。\n 2. 若两种类型的字节数不同，转换成字节数高的类型\n 3. 若两种类型的字节数相同，且一种有符号，一种无符号，则转换成无符号类型\n 4. 所有的浮点运算都是以双精度进行的，即使仅含float单精度量运算的表达式，也要先转换成double型，再作运算\n 5. char型和 short型参与运算时，必须先转换成int\n\n\n# p2433 综合题(数学根号,幂运算库math.h)\n\n问题 1\n\n请输出 i love luogu!\n\n问题 2\n\n这里有 10 个苹果，小a 拿走了 2 个，uim 拿走了 4

补充知识 组合数公式\n\n两两组合的数量可以通过组合数学中的组合公式来计算。对于从 ( n ) 个不同元素中选取 ( k ) 个元素的组合（不考虑顺序），组合数量可以用以下公式表示：\n\n$ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! \\times (n - k)!} $\n\n其中 $ n!表示表示表示 n$ 的阶乘，即 $ 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times

知识点思考\n\n在代码开头写了一个辅助函数，用来辅助后面的运算，可以看到在这个位置\n\nvector<int>& digitCount\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n使用了&这个符号，这个符号的意思是引用符号，意味着这个动态数组将会直接被引用，在这个特定的情况下，如果你在 countDigits 函数的参数中不使用 &（即不使用引用传递），程序仍然可以运行，但它将无法按预期工作。原因在于不使用引用传递意味着函数将接收 digitCount 向量的一个副本，而非原始向量本身。\n\n不使用引用传递的后果是：\n\n 1. 副本创建：当 digitCount 作为参数传递给 countDigits 函数时，将创建它的一个副本。这意味着在函数内部对 digitCount 所做的任何更改都只会影响这个副本，而不会影响原始向量。\n\n 2. 无法更新原始向量：由于 digitCount 在函数中是一个副本，因此函数内对其的修改不会反映到调用函数时使用的原始向量中。这意味着尽管函数可能正确地计算了数字的出现次数，但这些计算结果不会被保存到原始的 digitCount 向量中。\n\n 3. 性能问题：对于大型数据结构（如向量），创建副本可能会导致不必要的性能开销。\n\n因此，如果你希望 countDigits 函数能够实际更新传递给它的 digitCount 向量，你应该使用引用传递（即在参数前加上 &）。这确保了函数内对向量所做的任何更改都会直接反映到原始向量上，从而使得这些更改在函数外部也是有效的。',normalizedContent:'# hw机考

知识点思考\n\n在代码开头写了一个辅助函数，用来辅助后面的运算，可以看到在这个位置\n\nvector<int>& digitcount\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n使用了&这个符号，这个符号的意思是引用符号，意味着这个动态数组将会直接被引用，在这个特定的情况下，如果你在 countdigits 函数的参数中不使用 &（即不使用引用传递），程序仍然可以运行，但它将无法按预期工作。原因在于不使用引用传递意味着函数将接收 digitcount 向量的一个副本，而非原始向量本身。\n\n不使用引用传递的后果是：\n\n 1. 副本创建：当 digitcount 作为参数传递给 countdigits 函数时，将创建它的一个副本。这意味着在函数内部对 digitcount 所做的任何更改都只会影响这个副本，而不会影响原始向量。\n\n 2. 无法更新原始向量：由于 digitcount 在函数中是一个副本，因此函数内对其的修改不会反映到调用函数时使用的原始向量中。这意味着尽管函数可能正确地计算了数字的出现次数，但这些计算结果不会被保存到原始的 digitcount 向量中。\n\n 3. 性能问题：对于大型数据结构（如向量），创建副本可能会导致不必要的性能开销。\n\n因此，如果你希望 countdigits 函数能够实际更新传递给它的 digitcount 向量，你应该使用引用传递（即在参数前加上 &）。这确保了函数内对向量所做的任何更改都会直接反映到原始向量上，从而使得这些更改在函数外部也是有效的。',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2024/01/27

早期版本：\n\n1944年，中共晋察冀边区局在中共中央宣传委员会的同意下，由邓拓主持，首次收集了毛泽东历年来的文章28篇，由晋察冀日报社加以出版，并附录了古田会议的决议。全书共五卷，小32开，785页，印数2500册，定价300元边币。\n\n1945年7月苏中出版社出版了《毛泽东选集》（第一卷）。出版地江苏，1册，小32开，124页，封面印有毛泽东正面免冠木刻像。本卷收文11篇、序1篇。由当时的中国共产党苏中区党委宣传部部长俞铭璜主持，苏中出版社完成编印出版。\n\n1948年5月东北书店出版《毛泽东选集》。出版地哈尔滨，6卷合订1册，25开，999页，印数2万册。此版本的出版工作是当时中国共产党东北局宣传部张凯丰同志主持并选定篇名，由东北书店编印出版。\n\n1945年中共七大之后，毛泽东思想成为中共指导思想，各解放区纷纷出版毛泽东选集，到新中国成立前，各地共有21种不同版本。但这些版本均未得到毛泽东本人的审定。\n\n\n# 正式版本：\n\n新中国成立后，毛泽东在出访苏联时，斯大林建议毛泽东出版自己的文集。毛泽东接受了这一建议。1950年5月，中共中央政治局正式决定成立毛泽东选集编辑委员会，由刘少奇担任主任。具体编辑工作由陈伯达负责领导，胡乔木和田家英协助，全部文稿经过毛泽东本人修改审定。\n\n#

第五卷包括毛泽东在中华人民共和国建国后的文章共70篇，截至1957年。1977年4月15日由人民出版社正式出版发行。 毛泽东逝世后，华国锋决定继续出版毛选第五卷，在击溃四人帮后，于1976年10月8日再度开始筹备工作，由汪东兴为名义负责人，李鑫、吴泠西、胡绳、熊复实际负责编辑工作。\n\n第六卷：第五卷出版后，华国锋仍保留了毛泽东选集编辑委员会，准备筹备出版毛选第六卷（未出版）。\n\n1980年，毛泽东选集编辑委员会改组为中共中央文献研究室，此后未再出版毛选。已发售的毛选第五卷，也在1982年后停售，目前只能在一些二手书刊交易平台购得。"\n\n为了最终弥补“毛选只有部分毛泽东文章，尤其没有建国后文章”的缺憾，中共中央在1990年代又组织编印了《毛泽东文集》、《毛泽东早期文稿》（内部发行）、《建国以来毛泽东文稿》（内部发行）等著作集。\n\n\n#

主题 和 butterfly 主题 别的主题也会有一些可以的，不过最好准备一个测试用的 HTML 文件 这里提供一个我自己生成的 22 年最新版 Hexo 部署教程-Win\n\n\n\n\n# 不完美的\n\n\n# 使用iframe 组件\n\n插入很多文件惯用的方法\n\n前置条件\n\n我把源文件放在了 \\Blog\\Source\\HTML 里, 并在通用配置文件_config.yml里设置了禁止渲染此目录下的文件, 禁用渲染教程请看这篇文章Hexo跳过渲染教程 正常的 iframe 有个问题是高度会自动限制在 100 多 px,很影响体验，直接变成了画中画，如果想变成整个页面的一部分，高度跟随文档长度，请使用以下代码，自行替换 src 路径\n\n<iframe src="/HTML/C-刷题笔记-持续更新。html"  style="width:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" id="test" onload="this.height=100" ></iframe>\n<script type="text/javascript">\nfunction reinitIframe ( )\n{\n    var iframe = document.getElementById ( "test" ) ;\n    try\n        {\n        var bHeight = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight;\n        var dHeight = iframe.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight;\n        var height = Math.max ( bHeight, dHeight ) ;\n        iframe.height = height;\n        console.log ( height ) ;\n        }\n        catch ( ex ) {}\n}\nwindow.setInterval ( "reinitIframe ( ) ", 200 ) ;\n<\/script>\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n\n注意\n\n下面的function是为了让iframe框框适应文章高度，要不然默认才100多px的像素高度 该方法的缺点:无法识别文章目录,字数\n\n\n\n\n# 较完美的方案\n\n目前是使用一款开源的md文档编辑器生成的html复制进要上传的文件中,可以实现较完美的效果\n\n> 目前发现支持的有fluid和butterfly主题, 有些主题魔改较多需要自行尝试可否正常渲染, G不G的出来public文件\n\n警告\n\n缺点: 此方法并非完美无缺, 目前最大的问题是代码展示框无法显示代码语言类别和行号, 都显示是yaml, 不过有一键复制代码的按钮, 还算可以接受 所以请评估自己是否特别需要清晰的代码块\n\n\nMD编辑器相关信息\n\n名称: Yank Note GitHub链接: https://github.com/purocean/yn 作者博客: https://blog-purocean.vercel.app/\n\n> 下载即可使用, 免费版也有绝大多数功能且完整可用, 完整版仅需38元, 理念特别不错, 安利大家用用 而且开发者可以直接微信找他, 有啥不懂都可以问, 全栈大佬\n\n\n提示\n\n这是 hexo跳过渲染 那篇文章的编辑格式, 几乎是直接复制生成的html即可\n\n> 前面的前言部分是为了让文章封面摘要正常显示,否则可能会显示代码\n\n\n\n#

所以就要使用跳过渲染, 不过我发现网上教程有个点很容易坑人, 这里补充一下\x3c!--more--\x3e\n\n\n<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang xml:lang>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset="utf-8" />\n    <meta name="generator" content="Yank

两者都hexo都可以识别多级标题并生成目录\n\n\n# 包含样式代码修改\n\n警告\n\n使用包含样式的朋友看这里\n\n包含样式如果不在乎统计字数更推荐使用, 不过原代码直接使用可能会有bug, 请找到代码的这一行并把这个空行删掉\n\n.markdown-body .task-list-item input { margin: 0px 0.2em 0.25em -1.6em;

执行hexo渲染便可直接浏览啦\n\n\n\n\n# 结语\n\n这一通操作下来就可以形成全新的工作流, 即在一个文件夹里编辑所有的博客原稿, 在编辑完后生成html文件发布到自己的网站, 即可保证文章风格不需要额外调整, 也保证了自己的原稿可以保存在本地, 防止网站不弄了可独立的代码表达样式却无法在别处渲染\n\n当然最硬核的还是自己开发一个和主题和匹配的编辑器, 直接做到本地般和网页版原生样式同步\n\n欢迎在评论区发表自己的想法',normalizedContent:'# 前言 ( 持续更新，先更新到这先 )\n\n本身 hexo 是可以直接渲染 md 文件的，不过格式问题我在正经人中也有有提到，相信也会有人遇到和我同样的情形, 写点东西很多特殊格式得按主题要求的来, 一来二去还得写两个版本，结果发现不如简单粗暴的直接插入html，把自己想要的样式直接生成 html 文件放到博客中不就完美啦？因为本质上 hexo 也是把 md 渲染成 html 文件然后上传，打开网页更多像是在打开某个已经准备的好的 html\n\n下面就来分享一下我这段时间研究的各种插入 html 的奇葩方法\n\n重要提示\n\n目前能完美支持 html 插入的主题我暂时只知道 fluid 主题 和 butterfly 主题 别的主题也会有一些可以的，不过最好准备一个测试用的 html 文件 这里提供一个我自己生成的 22 年最新版 hexo 部署教程-win\n\n\n\n\n# 不完美的\n\n\n# 使用iframe 组件\n\n插入很多文件惯用的方法\n\n前置条件\n\n我把源文件放在了 \\blog\\source\\html 里, 并在通用配置文件_config.yml里设置了禁止渲染此目录下的文件, 禁用渲染教程请看这篇文章hexo跳过渲染教程 正常的 iframe 有个问题是高度会自动限制在 100 多 px,很影响体验，直接变成了画中画，如果想变成整个页面的一部分，高度跟随文档长度，请使用以下代码，自行替换 src 路径\n\n<iframe src="/html/c-刷题笔记-持续更新。html"  style="width:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" id="test" onload="this.height=100" ></iframe>\n<script type="text/javascript">\nfunction reinitiframe ( )\n{\n    var iframe = document.getelementbyid ( "test" ) ;\n    try\n        {\n        var bheight = iframe.contentwindow.document.body.scrollheight;\n        var dheight = iframe.contentwindow.document.documentelement.scrollheight;\n        var height = math.max ( bheight, dheight ) ;\n        iframe.height = height;\n        console.log ( height ) ;\n        }\n        catch ( ex ) {}\n}\nwindow.setinterval ( "reinitiframe ( ) ", 200 )

该方法的缺点:无法识别文章目录,字数\n\n\n\n\n# 较完美的方案\n\n目前是使用一款开源的md文档编辑器生成的html复制进要上传的文件中,可以实现较完美的效果\n\n> 目前发现支持的有fluid和butterfly主题, 有些主题魔改较多需要自行尝试可否正常渲染, g不g的出来public文件\n\n警告\n\n缺点: 此方法并非完美无缺, 目前最大的问题是代码展示框无法显示代码语言类别和行号, 都显示是yaml, 不过有一键复制代码的按钮, 还算可以接受 所以请评估自己是否特别需要清晰的代码块\n\n\nmd编辑器相关信息\n\n名称: yank note github链接: https://github.com/purocean/yn 作者博客: https://blog-purocean.vercel.app/\n\n> 下载即可使用, 免费版也有绝大多数功能且完整可用, 完整版仅需38元, 理念特别不错, 安利大家用用 而且开发者可以直接微信找他, 有啥不懂都可以问, 全栈大佬\n\n\n提示\n\n这是 hexo跳过渲染 那篇文章的编辑格式, 几乎是直接复制生成的html即可\n\n> 前面的前言部分是为了让文章封面摘要正常显示,否则可能会显示代码\n\n\n\n# 代码实际演示，想测试的可以直接粘贴本代码到要post的md文档里渲染测试下\n\n---\ntitle: (hexo)文件跳过渲染\ndate: 2022-04-10 15:57:37\ntags: [操作分享,避坑指南]\n---\n## 前言\n根目录下的`source`文件夹可以存放多类文件作为静态网站的资源库, 但是由于hexo的特性, 会把所有该目录下的文件渲染掉,

要不然万一图床挂了github访问不了也麻烦\n\n重点\n\n包含样式和内联样式分别代表不同的html生成模式, 根据作者的描述以及亲测\n\n包含样式: 对于各类样式的格式支持更好, 但字数统计会抽风, 且html代码需要处理下才可正常显示, 处理方法看下方\n\n内联样式: 不需要修改样式即可使用, 但目前版本部分组件兼容性不行别入可切换的group栏, 还得看后面优化, 不过字数统计正常 两者都hexo都可以识别多级标题并生成目录\n\n\n# 包含样式代码修改\n\n警告\n\n使用包含样式的朋友看这里\n\n包含样式如果不在乎统计字数更推荐使用, 不过原代码直接使用可能会有bug, 请找到代码的这一行并把这个空行删掉\n\n.markdown-body .task-list-item input { margin: 0px 0.2em 0.25em -1.6em;

执行hexo渲染便可直接浏览啦\n\n\n\n\n# 结语\n\n这一通操作下来就可以形成全新的工作流, 即在一个文件夹里编辑所有的博客原稿, 在编辑完后生成html文件发布到自己的网站, 即可保证文章风格不需要额外调整, 也保证了自己的原稿可以保存在本地, 防止网站不弄了可独立的代码表达样式却无法在别处渲染\n\n当然最硬核的还是自己开发一个和主题和匹配的编辑器, 直接做到本地般和网页版原生样式同步\n\n欢迎在评论区发表自己的想法',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2024/01/27

博客搭建思路\n\n基于Nodejs环境，使用其自带的npm软件管理系统（输入指令型系统），和万能的npm clone指令，克隆广大的开源静态博客开发者们开发的博客主程序，（例如：VuePress，Hexo等等）至本地\n\n> 与其说是程序，不如说是静态网站文件生成器更好理解，在运行后会根据文件夹内的文档文字配合各种图形化的代码，生成对应的图形化网站\n\n根据不同源码的说明，使用对应指令，以博客源码为基础运行，并生成静态网站所需的网站文件，并部署本地服务，生成一个本地的静态网站。\n\n> 相关资料：npm - 维基百科 Node.js - 维基百科\n> \n> 其特点是运行在本地IP中，可直接无网络访问\n\n完成初步内容编写配置后，通过Git（GitHub的项目管理软件）将生成好的网站文件上传至Github准备的仓库中，并开启Github提供的GitHub page（个人静态化网站服务），即可通过给定的网址访问（Page功能开启后默认是有访问网址给出的）\n\n\n# 操作指令\n\n很尴尬，之前辛辛苦苦搭建的博客，因为后面用的太少了，先后经历了图床Picgo代理出错（jsDelivr的CDN被墙导致）9.18号打开来，连怎么调试都忘了，比较离谱\n\n先记录下Git bash的vdoing主题的调试命令，防止忘记\n\n\n# Blog调试、部署指令\n\nnpm run deploy          #部署博客\nnpm run dev      \t\t#调试模式\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n部署模式是先生成静态文档文件，随后推送至GitHub对应仓库分支，并由GitHub完成对Page的更新\n\ndev调试模式则是部署本地网页，提供网站预览服务\n\n\n# Git常用指令\n\nGit的指令特别多且繁琐，所以专门记录几个最常用的，防止遗忘\n\n> 我的原Vuepress目前还能正常运行，但具体的工况已经不明，所以尽量按照现有的操作指令执行，以后再具体拆解，防止屎山崩盘。\n\n# 在完整的更新流程中运用的代码步骤\n\n博客目前为偶尔更新状态（马上开始长期更新）。\n\n配置有Github Action自动部署，所以仓库的结构为双分支，主分支master，副分支gh-pages。\n\n主分支存放博客程序文件，可存放文章及根据npm指令生成网站所需的静态文件。\n\n副分支存放静态网站文件\n\n因此为了防止出现网站的GitHub仓库主分支内的数据内容与本地出现差异（可能是自己编辑了然后忘了同步了），从而导致数据不同步问题，可能会引发一些不必要的麻烦。因此在更新前，需要将github仓库master分支（博客主程序）与本地的代码文件合并，根据实际情况决定是本地push上传还是云端pull拉取下载合并。\n\n> 通常是云端下载，因为GitHub action是一个很常用的在线编辑功能，该功能是直接修改GitHub仓库的代码的。而本地代码通常一修改完就会同步上传，不容易出现不同步的问题\n\n步骤一：\n\n在博客本地程序文件路径下运行Bash（可在Vscode里直接运行）\n\ngit pull #该命令用于从远程获取代码并合并本地的版本\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> git pull其实就是 git fetch 和 git merge FETCH_HEAD 的简写，该命令有结尾可以加一些对应参数，但由于我们需要合并的是master分支且该分支为主分支，刚好是默认选项，所以可以只输入pull即可\n> \n> 参考文章：git pull 命令 | 菜鸟教程 (runoob.com)\n\n步骤二：\n\n在更新所需更新的博客内容后使用如下命令\n\ngit add .  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t#将更新内容添加至本地git管理器中\ngit commit -m \'更新内容描述\'\t\t\t#确认更新内容，并“上膛”，标注更新内容\ngit commit -am \'更新内容描述\'\t\t\t#add、commit两个步骤合并为一个步骤的代码\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n> git commit -m的这个“-m”是main分支或者master分支的意思\n\n步骤三：\n\ngit push\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#将更新好后的文件上传至GitHub对应分支\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> 一定要执行步骤二才能正确push，不然无法push成功\n> \n> 更多的Git操作，请参考Git使用心得\n\n\n# 问题发现与解决\n\n\n# 代码框行号与代码行距不同\n\n其实是因为字体问题导致，更换字体后就没问题了\n\n\n# Git分支推送历史功能\n\n更新出现异常解决办法\n\n因为很喜欢给博客添加新功能，但又很容易出现不明bug，应该充分利用Git的定档备份功能，出现问题后及时回滚\n\n显示分支提交命令，会显示出提交历史，和提交代码\n\ngit log  #退出按Q即可\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n研究git checkout和git reset的区别，以及两者在操作上的区别\n\n\n# 实战操作方法\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况一：修改提交了commit且push\n\n方法一：\n\ngit reset --hard HEAD^ #一个^代表一个版本，倒退^^两个版本，~100=回退100个版本\ngit reset --hard id #回退到指定的id码\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n> 这个方法不推荐，因为会直接覆盖掉回退前的记录。(虽然不是真的删了)\n> \n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 直接变成 1 –> 2\n\n这个时候再PUSH会提示线上版本比线下版本新，所以的强制提交\n\ngit push -f #强制提交\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n方法二：\n\ngit revert commit_id #用log里的版本号完全替代掉commit_id这几个字符\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该命令意思是撤销，但保留提交记录\n\n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 变成 1 –> 2 --\x3e 3 –>4 将回退到2但以2作为主体新建新的4号commit\n> \n> 注意： 操作中commit_id应写需要被移除的版本号，而上面reset则是输入要去到的版本号\n\n输入完成后会进入和git commit --amend一样的界面，用I进入输入模式，在revert “”的冒号里输入更新的名称，输入:wq回车退出。\n\nrevert命令可以直接push，不需要担心push不上去，因为是新建的commit，不会出现线上版本比线下版本好的报错。\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况二：修改并提交了，但没有push\n\n 1. git reset --soft #撤销commit\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. git reset --mixed 撤销commit和add两个动作\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n> 以上两个办法都不会真正删除文件，Git中依旧可以查找出并还原，方便在各个版本间穿梭\n\n查看完整提交历史\n\ngit reflog \n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n# 0924分支推送记录\n\n当天由于更新出了bug，需要回滚到之前的版本，出现了很多问题，最核心的问题是\n\n * 回滚后无法提交git push。\n\n * 回退版本的reset和revert指令都不好用\n\n * git commit --amend指令很难用（其实是看错了操作方法）\n\n# Git操作收获——commit --amend\n\ngit commit --amend #修改提交信息（commit更新的那个信息修改）\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该模式下默认会显示很多行带注释的操作说明，按键盘I健即可进入编辑模式，键盘上下键确定输入位置\n\n进入编辑模式：\n\n小写i：在光标所在行位置停止不动开始写入内容\n\n大写I：在光标所在行行首开始写入内容\n\n小写a：在光标所在行当前字符后开始写入内容\n\n大写A：在光标所在行行尾开始写入内容\n\n小写o：在光标所在行下一行开始写入内容\n\n大写O：在光标所在行上一行开始写入内容\n\n退出编辑模式：\n\n:w：保存文本\n\n:q：退出编辑模式\n\n:w!：强制保存，在root用户下即使文本只读也可以强制保存\n\n:q!：强制退出，所有改动不生效\n\n:wq：保存并退出\n\n> 以上操作一定要记住，:号也是命令的一部分，退不出来是因为把冒号忘记了\n\n> 操作参考git commit --amend 以及退出 vim 编辑器_vmespmvk的博客-CSDN博客\n\n\n# 0925分之推送报错\n\n今天继续更新了一些网站样式，但由于中途好奇，用git checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\nTommyZeng@TommyLaptop MINGW64 /c/Tommy/DevProjectLocal/Blog-Vuepress (master|REBASE 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: You are not currently on a branch.\nTo push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)\nstate now, use\n\n    git push origin HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n究其原因，根据可查资料，显示当你在进行checkout时提供了一个commit而不是分支名称，你就进入了一种“特殊”的状态里 —— detached HEAD。\n\n可能发生的问题：\n\nGit中的HEAD指针能确定您当前的工作版本（以及放置在项目工作目录中的文件）。通常，当检出正确的分支名称时，Git会在您创建新提交时自动移动HEAD指针。您将自动进入所选分支的最新提交。\n\n当您选择通过commit哈希值进行checkout时，Git将不会为您执行此操作。结果是，当您进行更改并提交它们时，这些更改将不属于任何分支。\n\n# 解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的HEAD指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (HEAD) HEAD@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n# 0924分支推送记录\n\n当天由于更新出了bug，需要回滚到之前的版本，出现了很多问题，最核心的问题是\n\n * 回滚后无法提交git push。\n\n * 回退版本的reset和revert指令都不好用\n\n * git commit --amend指令很难用（其实是看错了操作方法）\n\n# git操作收获——commit --amend\n\ngit commit --amend #修改提交信息（commit更新的那个信息修改）\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该模式下默认会显示很多行带注释的操作说明，按键盘i健即可进入编辑模式，键盘上下键确定输入位置\n\n进入编辑模式：\n\n小写i：在光标所在行位置停止不动开始写入内容\n\n大写i：在光标所在行行首开始写入内容\n\n小写a：在光标所在行当前字符后开始写入内容\n\n大写a：在光标所在行行尾开始写入内容\n\n小写o：在光标所在行下一行开始写入内容\n\n大写o：在光标所在行上一行开始写入内容\n\n退出编辑模式：\n\n:w：保存文本\n\n:q：退出编辑模式\n\n:w!：强制保存，在root用户下即使文本只读也可以强制保存\n\n:q!：强制退出，所有改动不生效\n\n:wq：保存并退出\n\n> 以上操作一定要记住，:号也是命令的一部分，退不出来是因为把冒号忘记了\n\n> 操作参考git commit --amend 以及退出 vim 编辑器_vmespmvk的博客-csdn博客\n\n\n# 0925分之推送报错\n\n今天继续更新了一些网站样式，但由于中途好奇，用git checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\ntommyzeng@tommylaptop mingw64 /c/tommy/devprojectlocal/blog-vuepress (master|rebase 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: you are not currently on a branch.\nto push the history leading to the current (detached head)\nstate now, use\n\n    git push origin head:<name-of-remote-branch>\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n究其原因，根据可查资料，显示当你在进行checkout时提供了一个commit而不是分支名称，你就进入了一种“特殊”的状态里 —— detached head。\n\n可能发生的问题：\n\ngit中的head指针能确定您当前的工作版本（以及放置在项目工作目录中的文件）。通常，当检出正确的分支名称时，git会在您创建新提交时自动移动head指针。您将自动进入所选分支的最新提交。\n\n当您选择通过commit哈希值进行checkout时，git将不会为您执行此操作。结果是，当您进行更改并提交它们时，这些更改将不属于任何分支。\n\n# 解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的head指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (head) head@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支 #新建一个临时分支\nffa0c06 (head) head@{0}: commit: 新版界面字体优化——大改\nb1432cb (master) head@{1}: checkout: moving from b82a384012a1a07d083ed8afa0139bb87f98a2e1 to b1432cb \nb82a384 head@{2}: checkout: moving from

master\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n**步骤三：**将temp的分之内容merge合并到master，master就出现了新改动的代码\n\ngit merge temp\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n完成以上步骤后即可正常推送，恢复正常\n\n> 记得完成后删除temp分支，防止出现奇怪问题，删除方法\n> \n> git branch -d temp\n> \n> \n> 1\n> \n> 1\n\n\n# 0926分支回退并重新push操作调研\n\n> 前提：在完成开发后，发现出现不明bug，想回退到初始版本，并push到github，看看是不是玄学bug。\n\n> 这里面的核心问题是，github-action自动部署与本地部署的效果不一致，一个叫banner-arrow的动态箭头元素竟然无法渲染出正确的位置和动画（action的版本）。\n\n重命名分支操作\n\ngit branch -m master old-master #把master改名为old-master\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n强制推送至某分支\n\ngit push
