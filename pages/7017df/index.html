obey instructions given</p> <p>they were called upon to perform</p></blockquote> <p>Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer 'teacher-subject' that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn.</p> <blockquote><p>in the noble cause of education</p>

They also need to keep the money rolling in. Understandably, perhaps, they sometimes overstate their arguments. In 1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press release entitled: 'Two-thirds of the world's forests lost forever'. The truth turns out to be nearer 20%.</p> <blockquote><p>to be noticed</p> <p>mass media</p> <p>keep the money rolling in</p> <p>Understandably</p> <p>overstate their arguments</p> <p>issued a press release</p> <p>entitled</p></blockquote> <p>The writer quotes from the Worldwide Fund for Nature to illustrate how influential the mass media can be.</p> <blockquote><p>how influential the mass media can be.</p></blockquote> <p>Though these groups are run overwhelmingly by selfless folk, they nevertheless share many of the characteristics of other lobby groups.</p> <blockquote><p>overwhelmingly</p> <p>selfless folk</p> <p>nevertheless</p> <p>lobby groups</p></blockquote> <p>That would matter less if people applied the same degree of skepticism to environmental lobbying as they do to lobby groups in other fields.</p> <blockquote><p>would matter less</p> <p>applied the same degree</p> <p>skepticism</p> <p>environmental lobbying</p></blockquote> <p>A trade organization arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is instantly seen as self-interested.</p> <blockquote><p>arguing for</p> <p>seen as self-interested</p></blockquote> <p>Yet a green organization opposing such a weakening is seen as altruistic, even if an impartial view of the controls in question might suggest they are doing more harm than good.</p> <blockquote><p>seen as altruistic</p> <p>an impartial view of</p> <p>doing more harm than good</p></blockquote> <p>A third source of confusion is the attitude of the media.

His scans showed that at the beginning of a joke the listener's prefrontal cortex lit up, particularly the right prefrontal believed to be critical for problem solving. But there was also activity in the temporal lobes at the side of the head (consistent with attempts to rouse stored knowledge) and in many other brain areas. Then when the punchline arrived, a new area sprang to life - the orbital prefrontal cortex.
