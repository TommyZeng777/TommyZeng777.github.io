政府是否该支持本土电影</h2> <p>Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?</p> <p>It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidizing the industry.</p> <p>确实，在许多国家，外国电影比国产电影更受欢迎。这可能是由几个原因造成的，我认为政府应该通过补贴产业来推动本地电影制作。</p> <p>There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films are examples of such productions and the global appeal that they have. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.</p> <p>许多人觉得外国电影比他们自己国家制作的电影更有趣的原因有很多。首先，某些国家的成熟电影产业拥有巨额预算用于动作场面、特效以及在壮观的地点拍摄场景。像《阿凡达》或詹姆斯·邦德电影这样的好莱坞大片就是此类制作的例子，以及它们所拥有的全球吸引力。这些大预算电影之所以如此成功，另一个原因是它们经常由最著名的演员和女演员主演，并由最有成就的制片人和导演制作。相比之下，许多国家的低质量、低成本的电影制作就显得逊色了。</p> <p>In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.</p> <p>在我看来，政府应该在财务上支持本地电影产业。在每个国家，都可能有才华横溢的业余电影制作者，他们只是需要机会来证明自己。为了与海外的大预算制作竞争，这些人需要资金来支付电影工作人员、演员以及与制作高质量电影相关的其他一系列费用。如果政府帮助承担这些费用，他们将看到电影产业的就业增加、电影销售收入增加，甚至可能会看到游客数量上升。例如，新西兰就因为部分由政府补贴的《指环王》电影而见证了旅游业的增长。</p> <p>In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.</p> <p>总之，我相信增加财务支持可以帮助提高本地制作电影的质量，并使它们能够与目前主导市场的外国制作竞争。</p> <h2 id="simon-s202-外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱"><a href="#simon-s202-外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S202 外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱</h2> <p>Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p> <p>It is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. I completely disagree with this idea.</p> <p>有时候有人认为，来自海外的游客在参观重要的景点和纪念碑时，应该比当地居民支付更多的费用。我完全不同意这个观点。</p> <p>The argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation, and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.</p> <p>支持对外国游客收取更高价格的论点是，文化或历史景点通常依赖国家补贴来维持运营，这意味着居民通过税收系统已经为这些景点支付了费用。然而，我认为这是一种非常短视的观点。外国游客通过在食品、纪念品、住宿和旅行等广泛的商品和服务上的消费为东道国的经济作出贡献。每个国家的政府和居民都应该乐于为重要的旅游景点提供补贴，并鼓励世界其他地方的人们来访。</p> <p>If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.</p> <p>如果游客意识到他们必须支付更多的费用才能参观某个国家的历史和文化景点，他们可能会决定不去那个国家度假。以英国为例，旅游业及许多相关工作依赖于游客来到该国参观温莎城堡或圣保罗大教堂等地方。这两个地点无论国籍都是同一价格，这有助于推广国家的文化遗产。如果由于价格较高而导致海外游客停止来访，那么这些重要建筑的维护资金可能会不足。</p> <p>In conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.</p> <p>总之，我认为应该尽一切努力吸引海外游客，让他们支付比当地居民更多的费用将是适得其反的。</p> <h2 id="simon-s203-现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立"><a href="#simon-s203-现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S203 现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立</h2> <p>Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p> <p>People have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.</p> <p>现代人对于我们现在是否比以前更依赖他人持有不同观点。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去更加独立。</p> <p>There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.</p> <p>现在我们更相互依赖的主要有两个原因。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，特别是生活成本显著增加。例如，年轻人在购买房屋时往往依靠父母的帮助。房价比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助，许多人将无法支付定金和抵押贷款。其次，现在的人似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依靠祖父母和保姆来帮助照顾孩子。</p> <p>However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.</p> <p>然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小且更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依赖亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行和远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去本地大学，这种经历使他们在学会独立生活时变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它使我们能够独自一人并在世界任何地方工作。</p> <p>In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.</p> <p>总之，虽然有些理由让人相信现在的人们更加相互依赖，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更独立。</p> <h2 id="simon-s204-选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水"><a href="#simon-s204-选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S204 选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水</h2> <p>When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>Many people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered. Personally, I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career, because I believe that other factors are equally important.</p> <p>人们对于现代生活中我们是否比以前更依赖他人这个问题持有不同的看法。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去的人更加独立。</p> <p>On the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. For example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.</p> <p>有两个主要原因可以解释为什么我们现在可能更依赖彼此。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，尤其是因为生活成本的显著增加。例如，年轻成年人在购买房屋时往往依赖父母的帮助。房产价格比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助的话，许多人支付首付和按揭贷款是不可能的。其次，现在的人们似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依赖祖父母和保姆来照顾孩子。</p> <p>Nevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers’ levels of happiness and general quality of life. Secondly, many people’s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. Finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.</p> <p>然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更加独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小、更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依靠亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行，远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去当地的大学，这种经历使他们学会独自生活，变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它允许我们独自工作，从世界任何地方工作。</p> <p>In conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people’s choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.</p> <p>总之，虽然有一些理由认为现在的人更依赖彼此，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更加独立。</p> <h2 id="simon-s205动物实验是否应该禁止"><a href="#simon-s205动物实验是否应该禁止" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S205动物实验是否应该禁止</h2> <p>Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p> <p>It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.</p> <p>确实，在药物和其他产品被批准用于人类之前，通常会对动物进行测试。虽然我倾向于认为动物实验在道德上是错误的，但我必须支持为了药物开发而进行的有限数量的动物实验。</p> <p>On the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.</p> <p>一方面，反对动物实验有明显的伦理论点。以这一做法的一个常见例子来说，实验室的老鼠可能会被赋予一种疾病，以便可以测量新药的效果。反对此类研究的人士认为，人类无权让动物承受这种创伤，所有生物的生命都应该受到尊重。他们认为，对人类的好处并不足以证明造成的痛苦，科学家应该使用研究的其他方法。</p> <p>On the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.</p> <p>另一方面，可能并非总是有可靠的动物实验替代方案。支持在医学研究中使用动物的人认为，如果可以拯救人类生命，那么老鼠或大鼠所承受的某些痛苦是可以被证明的。他们争辩说，如果自己的家庭成员需要通过动物实验开发出来的医疗治疗，反对此类研究的人可能会有不同的感受。就我个人而言，我同意禁止非医疗产品的动物测试，但我觉得在新药和医疗程序方面，这可能是必要的恶。</p> <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.</p> <p>总之，在我看来，在开发出同样有效的替代方案之前，禁止对动物进行至关重要的医学研究测试将是错误的。</p> <h2 id="simon-s206-政府是否应该支持艺术工作者"><a href="#simon-s206-政府是否应该支持艺术工作者" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S206 政府是否应该支持艺术工作者</h2> <p>Some people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. Others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p> <p>People have different views about the funding of creative artists. While some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.</p> <p>人们对资助创意艺术家持有不同的看法。虽然有些人不同意政府对艺术家提供支持，但我认为艺术项目的资金应该来自政府和其他来源。</p> <p>Some art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. They serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.</p> <p>有些艺术项目确实需要国家的帮助。在英国，公共空间中有很多艺术作品，比如市中心的街道或广场。例如，在利物浦，城市的码头区域最近经过重新开发，有几座新的雕像和雕塑。这些艺术品代表了文化、遗产和历史。它们的作用是教育人们了解这座城市，并作为游客和观光客的地标或谈资。政府和地方议会应该支付给创意艺术家费用来创作这类艺术，因为没有他们的资金支持，我们的城市将会失去很多趣味和吸引力。</p> <p>On the other hand, I can understand the arguments against government funding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. For example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. These public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. Another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.</p> <p>另一方面，我能够理解反对政府资助艺术的观点。这种观点的主要理由是政府有更重要的事情要关心。例如，国家预算需要在教育、医疗保健、基础设施和安全等领域花费。这些公共服务对于一个国家的正常运作至关重要，而创意艺术家的工作，即使是在公共场所，也是一种奢侈。另一个原因是艺术家和其他专业人士一样，他们应该通过出售自己的作品来赚取自己的收入。</p> <p>In conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.</p> <p>总之，艺术家依赖其他财务支持的来源是有充分理由的，但在我看来，有时政府的援助是必要的。</p> <h2 id="simon-s207-青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作"><a href="#simon-s207-青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S207 青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作</h2> <p>Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.</p> <p>许多年轻人以志愿者的身份工作，这对个人和整个社会都只有好处。然而，我不同意因此就应该强迫所有青少年做无偿工作。</p> <p>Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.</p> <p>大多数年轻人在学习上已经承受了足够的压力，无需再增加业余时间工作的责任。学校的要求就像全职工作一样，老师们期望学生们在每天上课之外还要做作业和复习考试。当年轻人有一些空闲时间时，我们应该鼓励他们与朋友一起享受或者进行体育和其他休闲活动。他们在完成学业后还有很多年的工作时间。</p> <p>At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.</p> <p>同时，我认为社会没有任何好处可以从强迫年轻人做无偿工作中获得。实际上，我认为这违背了自由和公平社会的价值观，强迫一群人做违背自己意愿的事。这样做只会导致年轻人产生怨恨，他们会感觉自己被利用，而父母则不希望别人告诉他们如何养育子女。目前，没有人被强迫做志愿者，这无疑是最好的系统。</p> <p>In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.</p> <p>总之，青少年可以选择免费工作并帮助他人，但在我看来，我们不应该将其强制化。</p> <h2 id="simon-s208-我们为什么需要音乐"><a href="#simon-s208-我们为什么需要音乐" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S208 我们为什么需要音乐</h2> <p>There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?</p> <p>It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.</p> <p>确实，世界各地可以找到丰富多样的音乐风格。音乐因多种原因成为所有人类文化的重要组成部分，我认为传统音乐比现代国际音乐更重要。</p> <p>Music is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.</p> <p>音乐是伴随我们一生的东西。作为儿童，我们通过父母和老师教唱歌来学习语言，或仅仅作为一种享受。孩子们喜欢与他人一起唱歌，集体唱歌似乎能在参与者之间，不论年龄大小，建立一种联系。随着年龄的增长，人们的音乐喜好会发展变化，我们开始将最爱的歌曲视为生活故事的一部分。音乐以文字无法达到的方式表达和激发情感。简而言之，很难想象没有音乐的生活。</p> <p>In my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.</p> <p>在我看来，应该更重视传统音乐而不是已经变得如此流行的国际音乐。国际流行音乐往往朗朗上口且有趣，但本质上它是商业人士市场推广和销售的商业产品。相比之下，传统音乐表达了一个国家的文化、习俗和历史。传统风格，例如...(例子)...，将我们与过去连接起来，构成我们文化身份的一部分。如果流行音乐变得如此主导以至于这些民族风格消失，那将是一种真正的遗憾。</p> <p>In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.</p> <p>总之，音乐是人类存在的必要部分，我相信传统音乐应该比国际音乐更重要。</p> <h2 id="simon-s209-电脑游戏是好还是坏呢"><a href="#simon-s209-电脑游戏是好还是坏呢" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S209 电脑游戏是好还是坏呢</h2> <p>Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?</p> <p>Many people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.</p> <p>许多人，特别是儿童，喜欢玩电脑游戏。虽然我接受这些游戏有时可以对用户产生积极影响，但我认为它们更可能产生有害的影响。</p> <p>On the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.</p> <p>一方面，视频游戏既有趣又具有教育意义。用户或玩家被带入通常比现实生活更激动人心和更引人入胜的虚拟世界。从教育角度来看，这些游戏鼓励想象力和创造力，以及集中注意力、逻辑思维和解决问题的能力，这些都是游戏环境外的有用技能。此外，研究表明，计算机模拟游戏可以改善用户的运动技能，并帮助他们为现实世界的任务做准备，例如飞行。</p> <p>However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.</p> <p>然而，我认为这些好处被缺点所掩盖。游戏可能非常容易上瘾，因为用户不断获得分数、新目标和频繁的奖励以保持他们的游戏兴趣。现在许多儿童每天花几小时试图通过游戏的各个级别或获得比朋友更高的分数。这种上瘾可以产生从缺乏睡眠到学校问题的各种影响，当作业被牺牲以换取在电脑或游戏机上的几个小时。近年来肥胖的增加也部分与经常伴随游戏成瘾的久坐生活方式和缺乏运动有关。</p> <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.</p> <p>总之，我认为视频游戏的潜在危险比可能的好处更为重要。</p> <h2 id="simon-s210-平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法"><a href="#simon-s210-平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S210 平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法</h2> <p>In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.</p> <p>It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.</p> <p>确实，工业化国家的人们可以预期比以往任何时候都活得更长。虽然这一趋势无疑会带来一些负面后果，但社会可以采取措施来减轻这些潜在问题。</p> <p>As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.</p> <p>随着人们寿命延长和发达国家人口老龄化，可以预见到几个相关问题。主要问题是将明显有更多达到退休年龄并有资格领取养老金的人。年轻的工作成年人的比例将会减少，因此政府的税收相对于人口规模会减少。换句话说，人口老龄化将意味着工作成年人的税负加重。其他压力还包括对医疗保健的需求增加，以及年轻成年人将越来越需要照顾他们的老年亲戚的事实。</p> <p>There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.</p> <p>政府可以采取几项措施来解决上述问题。首先，一个简单的解决方案是提高工作成年人的退休年龄，可能从65岁提高到70岁。如今，这个年龄段的人往往足够健康，可以继续有效的工作生活。第二个措施是政府鼓励移民，以增加缴税的工作成年人的数量。最后，国家预算的资金将需要从其他领域调拨出来，用于为不断增加的老年公民提供必要的医疗、住宿和交通设施。</p> <p>In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.</p> <p>总之，随着国家人口老龄化，可以采取各种措施来解决必然出现的问题。</p> <h2 id="simon-s211-我们应该只关心自己的国家吗"><a href="#simon-s211-我们应该只关心自己的国家吗" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S211 我们应该只关心自己的国家吗</h2> <p>We cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</p> <p>Some people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.</p> <p>有些人认为，只要我们自己的社会中存在问题，我们就不应该帮助其他国家的人。我不同意这种观点，因为我认为我们应该尽可能帮助更多的人。</p> <p>On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.</p> <p>一方面，我接受帮助我们的邻居和同胞是重要的。在大多数社区中，都有一些贫困或以某种方式处于不利地位的人。例如，在即使是最富有的城市中也能找到无家可归的人，对于那些关心这个问题的人来说，通常有机会志愿投入时间或捐款支持这些人。在英国，人们可以通过多种方式帮助他人，从捐赠衣物到在汤厨房提供免费食物。由于问题就在我们的家门口，并且有明显的帮助方式，我可以理解为什么有些人觉得我们应该优先考虑本地慈善。</p> <p>At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.</p> <p>同时，我认为我们有义务帮助那些生活在我们国家边界之外的人。在一些国家，人们面临的问题比我们自己社区的问题要严重得多，而且帮助起来往往更容易。例如，当非洲国家的儿童因可治疗的疾病而死亡时，较富裕国家的政府和个人只需支付已有疫苗的费用就可以挽救生命。对国际慈善机构的小额捐款可能比在我们当地帮助的影响要大得多。</p> <p>In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.</p> <p>总之，虽然我们无法帮助所有人，但我认为国家界限不应阻止我们帮助那些有需要的人。</p> <h2 id="simon-s212-科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的"><a href="#simon-s212-科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S212 科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的</h2> <p>Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?</p> <p>It is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.</p> <p>确实，新技术对人们之间的沟通产生了影响。技术以各种方式影响了人际关系，我认为这些影响既有积极的也有消极的。</p> <p>Technology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. Secondly, services like Skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.</p> <p>技术对商业、教育和社交生活中的人际关系产生了影响。首先，电话和互联网使不同国家的商务人士能够进行交流，而不需要面对面会面。其次，如Skype这样的服务为学生和老师之间的关系创造了新的可能性。例如，学生现在可以通过视频与不同城市或国家的老师上课。最后，许多人使用社交网络，如Facebook，来结交新朋友和寻找有共同兴趣的人，并通过计算机而不是面对面进行交流。</p> <p>On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.</p> <p>一方面，这些发展可以非常积极。当通信只限于书信或电报时，不同国家的人们之间的合作要困难得多。如今，通过电子邮件、电话或视频的互动几乎与面对面会议一样好，我们许多人都从这些互动中受益，无论是在工作还是社交环境中。另一方面，新通信技术的可用性也可能导致人们孤立和阻碍真实的互动。例如，许多年轻人选择在线交友而不是与现实世界中的同龄人混在一起，而这些“虚拟”关系是对真实友谊的糟糕替代。</p> <p>In conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.</p> <p>总之，技术确实彻底改变了人与人之间的沟通方式，但这场革命的结果并非全都是积极的。</p> <h2 id="simon-s213-兴趣爱好应该是很困难的"><a href="#simon-s213-兴趣爱好应该是很困难的" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S213 兴趣爱好应该是很困难的</h2> <p>Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>Some hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.</p> <p>有些爱好相对容易，而其他爱好则更具挑战性。我个人认为，两种类型的爱好都可以很有趣，因此我不同意爱好需要具有难度才能享受的说法。</p> <p>On the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.</p> <p>一方面，许多人喜欢简单的爱好。一个对大多数人来说容易的活动示例是游泳。这项爱好需要的设备很少，学起来简单，而且不昂贵。我记得小时候在当地的游泳池学游泳，从来没有觉得那是一种要求高或有挑战性的经历。另一个我觉得简单有趣的爱好是摄影。在我看来，任何人都可以在不太了解操作相机的技术细节的情况下拍摄有趣的照片。尽管过程直接，但摄影是一项令人满足的活动。</p> <p>On the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. If an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. In my case, it took me around two years before I became competent at this activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. I believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.</p> <p>另一方面，困难的爱好有时候可以更加令人兴奋。如果一项活动更具挑战性，当我们成功完成时，我们可能会感到更大的满足感。例如，电影剪辑是一项需要高水平知识和专业技能的爱好。在我自己的例子中，我花了大约两年时间才在这项活动中变得熟练，但现在我享受它的程度远超过我开始时的情况。我相信，当我们在许多爱好中达到更高的表现水平时，我们会获得更多的快乐，因为结果更好，成就感也更大。</p> <p>In conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.</p> <p>总之，简单的爱好可以是有趣和放松的，但困难的爱好也可以因为不同的原因带来同样的乐趣。</p> <h2 id="simon-s214-平等社会和个人成就之间的关系"><a href="#simon-s214-平等社会和个人成就之间的关系" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S214 平等社会和个人成就之间的关系</h2> <p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?</p> <p>In my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. I completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.</p> <p>在我看来，平等主义社会是每个人都拥有相同权利和机会的社会。我完全同意在这种社会中，人们可以实现更多。</p> <p>Education is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. I believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. In a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. This kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.</p> <p>教育是个人生活成功的重要因素。我认为所有儿童都应该有机会接受免费教育，高等教育应该对所有选择追求大学学位的人免费或者负担得起。在一个没有免费学校教育或高等教育负担得起的社会里，只有来自较富裕家庭的儿童和年轻人才能获得最好的学习机会，因此他们会为就业市场做好更充分的准备。这种不平等将确保一些人的成功，但损害其他人的前景。</p> <p>I would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people’s freedom to succeed or fail. In other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. On the contrary, I believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. Those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. Inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.</p> <p>我认为平等的权利和机会并不与人们成功或失败的自由相冲突。换句话说，平等并不意味着人们失去了成功的动机，或者他们不被允许失败。相反，我相信如果大多数人认为他们生活在一个公平的社会中，他们会更有动力努力工作并实现他们的潜能。那些没有做出同样努力的人会知道他们浪费了机会。另一方面，不平等更有可能使人们失去动力，因为他们会知道成功的机会更倾向于那些来自有特权背景的人。</p> <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.</p> <p>总之，在我看来，平等与个人成功之间存在正相关关系。</p> <h2 id="simon-s215-大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等"><a href="#simon-s215-大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S215 大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等</h2> <p>Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>In my opinion, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.</p> <p>在我看来，男性和女性应该拥有相同的教育机会。然而，我不同意在每个大学科目中接受每个性别相等比例的观点。</p> <p>Having the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. If a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. For example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.</p> <p>在所有学位课程中拥有相同数量的男性和女性简直是不现实的。任何课程的学生人数都取决于该机构收到的申请。如果大学决定让男女生人数相等，它需要每个性别足够的申请者。实际上，许多课程对一种性别比另一种更受欢迎，力求性别比例平等并不切实际。例如，护理课程往往吸引更多女性申请者，如果需要50%的名额分配给男性，这些课程将难以招满。</p> <p>Apart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.</p> <p>除了上述实际问题，我还认为基于性别确定大学课程的录取是不公平的。大学应该继续根据他们的资格选择每个课程的最佳候选人。通过这种方式，男性和女性拥有相同的机会，申请者知道如果他们努力在学校取得好成绩就会成功。如果一名女学生是课程名额的最佳候选人，因为性别原因拒绝她而选择成绩较低或资格较少的男学生显然是错误的。</p> <p>In conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.</p> <p>总之，大学学生的选拔应基于功绩，改为基于性别的选拔程序既不切实际也不公平。</p> <h2 id="simon-s216-博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育"><a href="#simon-s216-博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S216 博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育</h2> <p>Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.Discuss both views and give you own opinion.</p> <p>People have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.</p> <p>人们对博物馆的作用和功能有不同的看法。我认为，博物馆既可以也应该既有趣又具有教育意义。</p> <p>On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.</p> <p>一方面，可以认为博物馆的主要角色是娱乐。博物馆是旅游景点，其目的是展示许多人想看的一系列有趣物品。如果普通访客必须阅读或听太多教育内容，可能会感到无聊，因此博物馆通常更注重享受而不是学习。这种类型的博物馆旨在视觉上壮观，并可能在展览中包含互动活动甚至游戏。</p> <p>On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science, and many other aspects of life.</p> <p>另一方面，有些人认为博物馆应该专注于教育。任何展览的目的应该是教给游客他们以前不知道的东西。这通常意味着需要解释博物馆展品背后的历史，这可以通过多种方式完成。一些博物馆雇用专业导游与游客交谈，而其他博物馆提供耳机，让游客可以听关于展览的详细解说。通过这种方式，博物馆可以在教育人们了解历史、文化、科学以及生活的许多其他方面发挥重要作用。</p> <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.</p> <p>总之，我认为一个好的博物馆应该能够提供一个有趣、愉快和具有教育意义的体验，这样人们可以在玩乐的同时学到东西。</p> <h2 id="simon-s217-应该上大学还是应该直接找工作"><a href="#simon-s217-应该上大学还是应该直接找工作" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S217 应该上大学还是应该直接找工作</h2> <p>Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.</p> <p>当青少年完成学业时，他们面临着是找工作还是继续深造的困境。尽管刚从学校毕业后直接找工作有一些好处，但我认为上大学或大专更好。</p> <p>The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.</p> <p>直接在学校毕业后开始工作的选项因几个原因而具有吸引力。许多年轻人希望尽快开始挣钱。通过这种方式，他们可以变得独立，并将能够负担得起自己的房子或开始组建家庭。就职业而言，选择找工作而不是继续学业的年轻人可能会更快进步。他们将有机会获得真实经验并学习与所选职业相关的实用技能。这可能会带来晋升和成功的职业生涯。</p> <p>On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher, or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.</p> <p>另一方面，我认为学生继续学习更有益。首先，许多职业需要学术资格。例如，没有相关学位就不可能成为医生、教师或律师。因此，大学毕业生可以获得更多更好的工作机会，他们的薪水通常也比那些学历较低的人高。其次，就业市场竞争越来越激烈，有时一家公司的一个职位可能有数百名申请者。没有大学或学院学历的年轻人将无法竞争。</p> <p>For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.</p> <p>基于上述原因，我认为如果学生在学校层次之外继续学习，他们在职业生涯中更有可能取得成功。</p> <h2 id="simon-s218-政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言"><a href="#simon-s218-政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S218 政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言</h2> <p>Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people.

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</p> <p>It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.</p> <p>确实，一些少数民族语言可能在不久的将来消失。尽管可以认为，政府通过允许这种情况发生可以节省资金，但我认为应该保护和保存这些语言。</p> <p>There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers, and marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.</p> <p>保存少数民族语言可能被视为浪费资金有几个原因。首先，如果一种语言只有少数人说，将需要昂贵的教育计划以确保更多人学习它，而国家将不得不支付设施、教师和市场营销的费用。这些钱可能更应该用于其他公共服务。其次，对于国家来说，只有一种语言会更便宜且更高效。政府可以削减与每个少数群体沟通相关的各种成本。</p> <p>Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs, and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.</p> <p>尽管有上述论点，我认为政府应该努力保存较少使用的语言。语言不仅仅是交流的工具；它与说这种语言的人的文化身份有着重要的联系。如果一种语言消失，一整种生活方式也会随之消失，我们将失去使社会更有趣的丰富文化多样性。通过花钱保护少数民族语言，政府还可以保存构成国家历史的传统、习俗和行为。</p> <p>In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term, this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.</p> <p>总之，如果我们允许少数民族语言消失，短期内可能会节省资金，但从长远来看，这将对我们的文化遗产产生极其负面的影响。</p> <h2 id="simon-s219-环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么"><a href="#simon-s219-环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S219 环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么</h2> <p>Explain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment.

This essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.</p> <p>人类对许多环境问题负有责任，但我们也可以采取措施减少我们对地球的破坏。本文将讨论环境问题以及政府和个人可以采取的措施。</p> <p>Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.</p> <p>环境面临的两大威胁是空气污染和废物。工厂的气体排放和车辆的尾气排放导致全球变暖，这可能在未来对地球产生毁灭性的影响。随着人口的增加，我们也在产生越来越多的废物，这些废物污染了土地并且污染了河流和海洋。</p> <p>Governments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.</p> <p>政府当然可以采取更多措施来减少空气污染。他们可以制定法律限制工厂排放，或强制公司使用来自太阳能、风能或水能的可再生能源。他们还可以对驾驶者和航空公司征收“绿色税”。通过这种方式，人们将被鼓励使用公共交通并减少出国航班，从而减少排放。</p> <p>Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. They can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for recycling glass, plastic, and paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.</p> <p>个人也应对他们对环境的影响负责。他们可以乘坐公共交通工具而不是驾车，选择包装较少的产品，并尽可能多地回收。现在大多数超市为购物者提供可重复使用的袋子，并在停车场设有回收玻璃、塑料和纸张的“回收站”。通过重复使用和回收，我们可以帮助减少废物。</p> <p>In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.</p> <p>总之，国家政府和个人都必须在照顾环境方面发挥作用。</p> <h2 id="simon-s220-为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福"><a href="#simon-s220-为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S220 为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福</h2> <p>Happiness is considered very important in life. Why is it difficult to define? What factors are important in achieving happiness?</p> <p>It is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. While the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.</p> <p>毫无疑问，大多数人希望在他们的生活中感到快乐。虽然快乐的个人本质使得它难以描述，但似乎确实存在一些我们都共有的关于体验或实现快乐的共同需求。</p> <p>Happiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. Nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take pleasure. Some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are much more important. At the same time, a range of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.</p> <p>快乐难以定义，因为对每个人来说意味着不同的事情。没有人能完全理解或体验另一个人的感受，我们都有自己特定的激情，从中获取快乐。例如，有些人从赚钱或取得成功中获得满足感，而对其他人来说，健康和家庭更为重要。同时，从兴奋到平和的一系列其他感受可能与快乐的概念相关联，因此同一个人可能会以多种不同的方式感到快乐。</p> <p>Although it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving it. Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. Our basic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasant life. Secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. Other key factors could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life.</p> <p>尽管给快乐下一个准确的定义似乎几乎不可能，但大多数人会同意实现快乐有一些基本前提条件。首先，如果一个人没有安全的居住环境和足够的食物，他或她很难感到快乐。我们的基本生存需求必须首先得到满足，之后我们才能过上愉快的生活。其次，生活中最大的快乐通常来自与家人和朋友的共同经历，很少有人满足于完全孤立地生活。其他关键因素可能是个人自由和生活的目标感。</p> <p>In conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each individual, but I believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.</p> <p>总之，快乐难以定义，因为它对每个人都是特定的，但我相信我们在体验快乐之前需要满足住所、食物和陪伴的基本需求。</p> <h2 id="simon-s221-你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源"><a href="#simon-s221-你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S221 你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源</h2> <p>Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I completely disagree with this point of view.</p> <p>In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21stcentury. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world’s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.</p> <p>I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth’s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth.</p> <p>In conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.</p> <h2 id="simon-s222-严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗"><a href="#simon-s222-严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S222 严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗</h2> <p>Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p> <p>People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.</p> <p>On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.</p> <p>On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that donot punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.</p> <p>In conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.</p> <h2 id="simon-s223-企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任"><a href="#simon-s223-企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S223 企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任</h2> <p>As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.</p> <p>On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.</p> <p>On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.</p> <p>In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.</p> <h2 id="simon-s224-政府如何让城市生活更美好"><a href="#simon-s224-政府如何让城市生活更美好" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S224 政府如何让城市生活更美好</h2> <p>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?</p> <p>Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.</p> <p>The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.</p> <p>However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.</p> <p>In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.</p> <h2 id="simon-s225-现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢"><a href="#simon-s225-现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S225 现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢</h2> <p>In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?</p> <p>In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.</p> <p>The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.</p> <p>However, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.</p> <p>In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.</p> <h2 id="simon-s226-大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的"><a href="#simon-s226-大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S226 大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的</h2> <p>Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p> <p>People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.</p> <p>There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.</p> <p>In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.</p> <p>In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.</p> <h2 id="simon-s227-让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪"><a href="#simon-s227-让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S227 让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪</h2> <p>Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.</p> <p>In my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.</p> <p>The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. One option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. This could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. A second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. Finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.</p> <p>In conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.</p> <h2 id="simon-s228-传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地"><a href="#simon-s228-传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simon S228 传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地</h2> <p>The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</p> <p>It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.</p> <p>On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.</p> <p>On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.</p> <p>In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.</p></div></div> <!----> <div class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/TommyZeng777/TommyZeng777.github.io/edit/master/docs/04.英语学习/03.雅思考试攻略/05.Writing Template S2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">在线编辑</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">最近编辑时间:</span> <span class="time">2025/01/27  22:38:55</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav-wapper"><div class="page-nav-centre-wrap"><a href="/pages/b73f9b/" class="page-nav-centre page-nav-centre-prev"><div class="tooltip">Writing Template S1</div></a> <a href="/pages/568017/" class="page-nav-centre page-nav-centre-next"><div class="tooltip">Writing Reference</div></a></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
