### How to introduce yourself at the beginning of a interview ？
（1）如何在 面试 开头做好 自我介绍 ？
You must also be prepared for the common mistakes people make in interviews. Be assertive not aggressive, find a middle way between boasting and passivity. This is an opportunity for you to talk about your personal characteristics and skills. Remember to remain relevant and to stress achievements that translate into strengths you would bring to the job.
你必须防止别人会在 面试 中犯的错误。表现得肯定自信但是不咄咄逼人，不吹嘘自己也不处于被动状态。这是一个你很好的谈你的个人特色和技巧的机会。记住提到你今后在公司中将能发挥的相关成就。
### What are your strengths and weaknesses?
（2）合理地描述自身的优点和缺点
Question:
提问：你的优点和缺点各是什么？
Hint:Talk about relevant strengths for the job and irrelevant weaknesses. If you can, mention a personal weakness that could be seen as a professional strength; I'm a workaholic! (though avoid being seen as insincere)
提示:谈谈跟你工作相关的优势和不相关的缺点。如果可以的话，提出看起来像职业优点的个人缺点；例如我是一个工作狂！（当然尽量不显得虚伪。）
For example
例如：“我在做展示时候一般会紧张，但是通过展示我又会获得更多自信。”
### Why did you leave your last job?
（3）当被问及上一份工作的离职原因，怎么回答？
Question:
提问：为什么放弃上一份岗位？
Hint: Don't lie and don't speak badly of your past employer
提示：不要说谎，不要说前一任老板的坏话
For example
例如：“我觉得上一份工作没有上升的空间了，我需要一份更有挑战性的工作。”
又或者：“我觉得我已经在我的上一份岗位上发挥了所有的才能，我现在只是28岁，希望自己能够承担更多的责任，接受更多挑战。”
### What are your salary requirements?
（4）当被问及期望薪资，怎么回答？
Question:
提问：你对薪资的要求是怎么样的？
Hint:State that although salary is not your primary consideration you do have to pay the bills.
提示：传达出“工资不是你 找工作 的第一标准，但是日子还是要过的”的意思即可。
For example
“薪资水平不是我衡量一份工作的第一标准，但是我也是需要还各类账单的，所以任何合理的出价我都是会考虑的。”
Say you would be open to any reasonable offer and if pressed for a figure give a number that shows you have researched the local job market.
如果按照以上的回答了，对方还要求给出一个范围的话就提出一个跟当地此类工作水平的薪资水平。
### Pay attention to the simple questions
（5）当被问及看似与无关工作的细节，如兴趣爱好等，怎么回答？
Sometimes an interview question might seem very simple but, don’t be deceived, there is always a reason for them asking that question. Here is some questions & answers：
有时候一个 面试 问题看上去也许非常的简单，但是不要被蒙骗了。HR问你的任何问题都是有他的理由的，下面就是一些示例：
Q: If you had to compare yourself with any animal; which one would it be and why?
问：如果把你比作一种动物，你觉得你是哪一种？为什么？
A:
答：狮子，因为虽然他们很独立，他们也能很好地团队合作。
Q: Describe how a sport or hobby taught you a lesson in teamwork?
问：说一下哪种体育运动或者爱好教你很好的团队合作？
A:
答：大学时期，我的篮球教练教我怎么在最有利于团队的情况下传球，所以现在我总是会从考虑团队利益的情况下行动。
Q:
问：你一般读什么书或者杂志？
Hint:The books you read tell the interviewer something about your personality. Mentioning a relevant journal would be a good idea, saying you don’t like to read would be a bad idea!
提示：人们通过你的书知道你的性格，所以提到一两份刊物会是不错的回答，说你不喜欢阅读是很坏的回答方式。
A:
答：一份有关公司行业内的商业杂志。
Question:
问：你在学校最喜欢的科目是什么？为什么？
Hint: Mention anything that shows an interest in the employer's kind of work. Bring up any interesting or unusual projects in that area.
提示：提到跟面试公司经营范围内有关系的科目，展示你对它的兴趣，提到那个学科涉及到的一些有趣的或者不寻常的项目。
Question:
问：你在空闲时间喜欢做什么？
Hint: It’s good to have strong outside interests and if they are pastimes that would be an asset to the job, so much the better.
提示：提到一个户外兴趣很不错，如果那还是一种对该工作来说是一种资产的消遣方式的话，那就更好了。
### Do you have any questions for us?
（6） 当HR问：“你还有什么问题要问吗”，该怎么回答？
Question:
提问：你有什么问题要问我的吗？
Show you have been attentive during the interview; develop questions that have arisen during the interview.
这个问题是要看你是否在面试过程中集中精神了，可以扩展在面试中提到的问题。
Towards the end of your interview you should have asked the key question about what happens next. Something like “How soon will you make a decision on whom you plan to hire?
在面试的最后，你应该要问面试官一些重点问题，例如接下来的程序是怎样的。再如“多久会收到是否录用的决定”，这会给你自己一个时间范围
For example: Yes - about your ethical policy, and your carbon footprint...I was wondering whether you are planning to reduce your carbon footprint and whether all your products are ethically sourced?
其他回答例如：是的，有关你们的伦理道德政策，还有你们的碳足迹，我在好奇你们是否会降低你们的碳排放量，是否你们的所有产品都是从伦理道德角度出发去寻找生产商的。
7.问: Tell me about yourself.
答: I was born and raised in Dalian, China. I attended the University of Beijing and received my masters degree in Economics. I have worked for 5 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for various companies including Rossi Consultants, Peoples Insurance of China and Pepsi. I enjoy playing soccer in my free time and traveling.
答: Ive just graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Computers Science. During the summers, I worked as a systems administrator for a small company to help pay for my education.
评语: 这个问题的目的是想大概地了解你，所以无需讲太多细节的东西。你的回答通常会帮助面试官决定下个问题问什么。除了给对方一个整体的印象，最重要的是着重讲和工作有关的经验。工作经验是大多数面试中最重要的环节，比学历更重要
8.问: What type of position are you looking for?
答: Im interested in an entry level (beginning) position.
答: Im looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience.
答: I would like any position for which I qualify.
评语:对于一个英语非母语的申请人，许多公司期望你能从低做起，慢慢弥补语言方面的不足。就算你以前很成功有多年经验，也应当有这个心理准备。
9.问: Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position?
英语面试问题及回答
答: I am more interested in a full-time position. However, I would also consider a part-time position.
评语: 尽量留最大的余地争取机会。因为只要工作拿到了，以后的事情就容易把握，主动性大多了。
10.问: Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job?
答: I advised customers on financial matters. After I consulted the customer, I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis.
评语: 提到过往工作经验时，注意越详细越好。新移民最容易犯的错误之一是讲过去经历时太过笼统。雇主是想知道你到底做什么以及你做得怎么样，你讲得越详细，他们就越能知道你是否在行。你可以换着用一些不同的词汇来形容，而且尽量不要每句话都用“I”开头。记得用过去时态。
### 问: What is your greatest strength?
答: I work well under pressure. When there is a deadline (a time by which the work must be finished), I can focus on the task at hand (current project) and structure my work schedule well. I remember one week when I had to get 6 new customer reports out by Friday at ### I finished all the reports ahead of time without having to work overtime.
答: I am an excellent communicator. People trust me and come to me for advice. One afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome (difficult) customer who felt he was not being served well. I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together.
答: I am a trouble shooter. When there was a problem at my last job, the manager would always ask me to solve it. Last summer, the LAN server at work crashed. The manager was desperate and called me in (requested my help) to get the LAN back online. After taking a look at the daily backup, I detected the problem ahttp://www.wenku1.comnd the LAN was up and running (working) within the hour.
评语: 不用谦虚，充满自信地把自己最好的方面都抖出来。记得要给一些具体的例子，举例时变化用词。
12.问: What is your greatest weakness?
答: I am overzealous (work too hard) and become nervous when my co-workers are not pulling their weight (doing their job). However, I am aware of this problem, and before I say anything to anyone, I ask myself why the colleague is having difficulties.
答: I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisified. However, I began setting time-limits for myself If I noticed this happening.
评语: 这其实是一个很巧妙的问题，你要讲得出一个其实是优点的缺点。比如工作太认真啦，对自己对人要求很高啦，工作很追求完美啦，等等。在讲到缺点后要记得说你一直在致力于改善。
13.问:Why do you want to work for us?
答: After following your firms progress for the last 3 years, I am convinced that Smith and Sons are becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be part of the team.
答: I am impressed by the qualitiy of your products. I am sure that I would be a convincing salesman because I truly believe that the Atomizer is the best product on the market today.
评语: 对这个问题你要事前做研究，通过看公司网站，其他有关信息等。越了解公司，对你越有利。
14.问: When can you begin?
答: Immediately.
答: As soon as you would like me to begin.
评语: 充分表示你想要工作!

15.对于英语非母语的人来说，最重要和最难的是用英语讲述大量细节，尤其是复杂的细节。
然而，雇主是很有必要知道你能否把工作范畴内的细节表达清楚，这对你是否胜任至关重要。不要太过担心语法问题。只要用词够多，内容够细，只要不影响理解，语法往往不是那么重要。
面试时招聘人员总会问你："Do you have any questions?"其中一忌就是用"nothing"来回答这个问题。问什么问题，对你的印象分有帮助，显示你是一个用心的人。一般来说，围绕着这些话题来问比较得体：
the competitive environment in which the organization operates 公司营运所处的竞争环境
executive management styles 管理高层的风格
what obstacles the organization anticipates in meeting its goals 公司在达到其目标过程中预计会遇到什么障碍
how the organizations goals have changed over the past three to five years 公司的经营方向在过去三到五年内有什么变化
第一次面试，或者在双方未有确定的意向以前，除非是已经到了签OFFER的阶段，最好不要问待遇如何。那样显得你更关心公司能为你做什么，而不是你为公司能做什么。
具体来说，你可以问以下问题：
1. What are the main objectives and responsibilities of the position?
2. How does the company expect these objectives to be met?
3. What obstacles are commonly encountered in reaching these objectives?
4. What is the desired time frame for reaching the objectives?
5. What resources are available from the company and what must be found elsewhere to reach the objectives?

常见问答
First One: Work experience
"work experience" is the type of work you"ve done in the past.If you haven"t started working yet
you can say "center now I"m still a student." or "I"m a recent grad and Ihaven"t started working yet."
In the second sentence, "recent grad" is short for"recent graduate" and means that you have just finished
school.
请告诉我你过去的工作经验，工作经验就是你过去所做的工作。如果尚未开始工作，就可以回答
“center now I"m still a student.”（现在我还是个学生。）或者说“I"m a recent grad and
I haven"t started working yet.”（我刚刚毕业，还没有开始工作。）“recent grad”是“recentgraduate”
的缩写，意思是刚刚毕业。
Second One: What"s your greatest weakness?
This is a popular question that western employers like to ask to make candidates nervous! In fact,
they ask this to know how you respond to a difficult question. You shouldn"t answer by telling your
greatest weakness since you might not get the job! Instead,you can tell them something that isn"t
directly related tothe jobposition.
你最大的缺点是什么？西方老板特别爱问这个问题，让面试者感到很紧张。事实上，他问这个问题是看你对
棘手问题的反应。你没必要如实回答你的弱点，因为那有可能让你得不到这份工作。相反，你可以告诉他们一些
与工作不直接相关的事情。
Third One: Why do you feel you are qualified for this job?
This question is a good opportunity to brag a little bit.You should talk about some extra skills
you have that maybe wasn"t included in your resume, or talk about your greatest strengthinmore detail.
你为什么觉得自己胜任这份工作？这时候你要充分发挥你的“自夸”本领。你可以讲述一些简历资料
里面没有包括的技能；或者是再详细强调一下你的特长。
Fourth One: What kind of salary did you have in mind?
Salary is how much money you earn, usually per year. When asked this, it"s best to answer with
a salary range or approximation and not an exact figure. This shows that you are familiar with the
industry if you know what the approximate salary should be.
你期望的薪水是多少？“salary”就是你赚多少钱，通常是年收入。回答这个问题时，最好说出一个大致范围，
而不是一个确切的数字。如果你能说出这个工资范围，那就说明你对此行业非常了解。
Fifth One: If hired, when could you start work?
When answering this it"s best not to say you can start center away. This might make you seem very
desperate for a job. A safe answer would be "I can start at the beginning of nextmonth."
如果雇佣的话，你什么时候开始工作？回答这个问题时。一定要注意！不要说我马上可以工作。那会让对方认为
你非常迫切地需要这份工作。一个非常保险的回答可以是“Icanstart at the beginning of next month.”（我下月初可以开始上班。）
Sixth One: What kind of work does the posi-tion involve?
You can ask this to clarify exactly what kind of work you"llbedoing.
这个职位包括哪些工作？通过问这句话，你可以清楚地了解到你的工作内容。

英语面试注意点
1、流利而准确的英语表达能力将成为你的职场竞争力。
外企英语面试和雅思托福等出国考试不一样。前者是竞争型测试，后者是通过型测试。
也就是说，参加出国考试的通过人数没有名额限制，你只要能力足够高，发挥得足够好，
就能够pass。然而外企招聘却是有名额限制的，只有优于他人的应聘者才可能在
外企英文面试中脱颖而出。专业而熟练的职业技能结合流利的口语表达、清晰的英语思维、地道的英语发音、
准确而恰当的俚语运用、跨文化沟通技巧等将成为你应聘外企的主要竞争力。
外教William Hill说：“I interviewed a lot of candidates in Shanghai, a few of which
did impress me deeply with veteran skills. I was surprised at their spoken English because
they appeared to be a Chinese American. I just couldn't decline them.”
在多人竞争某一职位时，简单的“可以理解的”初级英语层次显然不能够凸显个人实力。
William Hill先生建议应聘者不妨关注一下自己的英语表达和发音，中国式英语是应该避免的，
多了解你即将应聘的外企的国家文化，因为每个国家的文化不同会使面试过程的氛围也不同。
相对来讲美国企业的面试比较relaxing，有点像一般的聊天，只不过聊的内容不是普通的“闲聊”。
如果在外企英文面试中能准确地融入一些该国的俚语，则你的面试过程将会非常的愉快。
2、外企招聘时看重哪些英语证书？
如果外企的面试官是老外的话，那么国内的一些英语考试如CET4、CET6、TEM4、TEM8
等可能作用并不明显，除了老外不了解这些考试外更多的在于这些考试并没有对考生的口语能力
进行测试。关于这个问题William Hill说：“I don't think candidates with those certificates are up to par,
because what we focus on is the communicating ability. And, as is known, CET and TEM don't seem
to test one's speaking skills. But he who owns an IELTS or TOEFL certificate may be preferred.”
可见雅思、托福等出国英语证书可能在一定程度上增强应聘者的竞争力。
常见典型问题拆招：
3、关于介绍自己的：Could you say something about yourself? Could you sell yourself within a few minutes?
这个问题可以说是大众问题了，通过这个问题，面试官一方面大致把握一下你的英语水平，
一方面找到和你交流的突破点，探寻本质，打破沙锅是人力资源经理的一惯作风，
因此回答这个问题时务必事实求是，否则后面很可能无法自圆其说。不过这个问题其实也不复杂，
外教William Hill告诉我们说与其说这个是测试应聘者的问题，不如说是应聘者卖弄自己
英语的大好机会，So don't miss the boat！
你可以从以下几个方面突出自己：职业技能强项，该技能的深入程度，该技能完成过的项目
以及自己其他相关方面的深入研究和学习、探索，注意突出个性。请不要在自己的姓名、年龄、
毕业学校、兴趣爱好等方面浪费时间，也不用再把你的简历背诵一遍，因为老外已经看过你的CV了。
时间可以根据情况控制在2-3分钟的样子。注意外企英语面试是口头表达的过程，建议在随后的互动
过程中多多使用口语化的表达，尽量让自己融入整个对话（Conversation），而不是在教条式的背诵文章。
4、关于应聘动机的：Why do you wanna work for us? What makes you come here today?
面试官想了解一下你的求职动机，看看你对公司是否有所了解。显然这个功课是你来面试之前
就应该做好的，所以千万别说开始面试了还不知道这个公司是做什么的。请在回答这个问题的
时候充满信心，不要说是来试试的（you really wanna take a try?），如果能事先将公司信息整理
好并梳理一下和自己的职业技能相结合来介绍，则可谓Perfect Response。
5、关于你的弱点：What do you think is your greatest weakness? May I know it?
注意后面那句是客气的，千万别说No，也别说"I don't think I have any weakness"。
客观地评价一下自己确实存在但对工作并不重要的缺点是一个不错的办法，当然别忘了
要提一下你将采取什么样的办法来克服或弥补自己的缺点。
6、关于你过去的工作：How do you like your last job? Why did ya leave your last job?
面试官想通过你对过去的工作的看法，了解你对今后的工作态度。如果你说你不喜欢你过去的
工作，那么你将面临“既然不喜欢为什么却会选择”这样的难题，最终结果是“缺乏判断力或者没有主见”。
事实上你既然做过以前的工作，那么应该多少还是比较喜欢的，不妨谈谈过去的工作特点和你所负责
的主要任务，但要突出过去的工作趋于平淡且失去挑战性，你可以在更艰巨的任务和岗位中发挥能力。
同时面试官极有可能问你以前的同事和上司的一些问题，切记不要把责任归咎到别人身上。
7、关于你将来的打算：How long do you propose to work here?
这个问题对职场老手来说简直就是a piece of cake。简洁的几句话表达出你希望在这个公司一直
工作下去即可，同时要体现出你的上进心，渴望与公司一起发展和进步，不断提升自己。
8、反问的机会：Ok, now if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
“Nope, I have none, thanks!”这样的回答就完全错了。抓住这个机会，把事先准备好的问题
和盘托出，多了解一些关于公司发展、职位要求、员工培训、员工晋升、员工福利等方面的问题。
其实外企英语面试并没有什么特别之处，话题内容上也跳不出中文面试的框框，无非是用英语来
表达而已。在某些特定职位的招聘上，可能外企更看重的是个人的职业能力而对英语表达要求甚低；
或者在某些特定的条件下没有太多的竞争者，应聘者不需要具备非常好的英语听说能力就可拿到offer。
但这些情况并不影响我们对自身竞争力的提升，卓越的英语听说能力必将为你的职场生涯带来裨益。
一些可能用得上的俚语表达：
注意:
1、up to par 达到标准。
2、I won't let the cat out of the bag. 我会严守秘密。
3、get on the ball 开始（做事）
4、a piece of cake 形容非常容易
5、face the music 勇于承担责任
### What is important to you in a job? 
Mention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, t 
he feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution. 

### Why do you want to work for this organization? 
Cite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working condit 
ions. Stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organ 
ization. 

### Why should we employ you? 
Point to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm.
Mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to
learn and to become productive quickly. If the job involves management responsibilities, refer to
past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team. 

### If we hire you, how long will you stay with us? 
Answer by saying along these lines: "As long as my position here allows me to learn and
to advance at a pace with my abilities." 

### Can we offer you a career path? 
Reply: "I believe you could, once I know the normal progression within the organization.
Can you tell me about it?" The answer may be revealing. 

### What are your greatest strengths? 
Give a response like one of the following: "I can see what needs to be done and do it",
"I'm wiling to make decisions", "I work well with others," " 
I can organize my time efficiently." 

### What are you greatest weakness? 
Identify one or two, such as the following:" I tend to drive myself too 
hard", " I expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " I like to se 
e a job done quickly, and I'm critical if it isn't." Note these weaknesses c 
ould also be regarded as desirable qualities. The trick with this question i 
s to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.
### What didn't you like about previous jobs you've held? 
Discuss the things you didn't like, but avoid making slighting reference 
to any of your former employers. 

### How do you spend your leisure time? 
Mention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.
### Are there any weaknesses in your education or experience? 
Take stock of your weaknesses before the interview. Practice discussing them in a positive light.
You'll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer. 

1### Where do you want to be five years from now? 
Saying that you'd like to be president is unrealistic, yet few employers want people who are content
to sit still. You might say, "in five years, I'd like to have my boss's job. " If you can't qualify for your
boss's job by then, you may not be the fright candidate. 

1### What are your salary expectations? 
If you are asked this at the outset, it's best to say, "Why don't we discuss salary after you decide
whether I'm right for the job? "But if the interviewer asks this after showing real interest in you, speak up.
She or he will probably try to meet your price. If you need a clue about what to ask for, say,
" Can you discuss your salary range with me?" 

1### What would you do if....? 
This question is designed to test your reposes. For example: "What would 
you do if your computer broke down during an audit?" Your answer there isn't nearly so important as
your approach to the problem. And a calm approach is best. Start by saying, "One thing I might do is ..."
Then give several alternative choices. 

1### What type of position are you interested in? 
Job titles and responsibilities vary from firm to firm . So state your skills instead, such as
"I'm good at figure work," and the positions that req 

1### Tell me something about yourself. 
Say you'll be happy to talk about yourself, and ask what the interviewer 
wants to know. If this point is clarified, respond. If not, tell why you feel your skills will contribute to
the job and the organization. This question gives you a great opportunity to sell yourself. 

1### Do you have any questions about the organization or the job? Employers like a candidate who
is interested in the organization. so this is a perfect time to convey your interest and enthusiasm

面试的最后需要做些什么?
关于真正的面试最后要提醒的是：结束面试时要说：“我对这份工作非常感兴趣，我下一步要干些什么？”
朋友，你是否在热切地盼望着？如果聘用你，那将是他们的幸运！
One last great tip about the actual interview: Always end the interview with, “I am very interested in
the position. What are the next steps to take?” Boy, are you eager? They’d be lucky to have you!

准备好你要提出的问题 
在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先，
不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。
这里有风个备选问题：
请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会
参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？

考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。
Have questions of your own. Toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean
into you and say,” Do you have any questions for me? You must have questions. First, don’t rush
into your answer. Look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask
an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. Here is a handful of potential questions:

How would you describe a typical workday?/What is the best part of working at this company for you?
Are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets
of the company?/Why did you join the company?
Interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.

常见问题做好准备 

针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案：
谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？
/ 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/
你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历
和大学活动与这份工作有何关联?

最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职，
参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要
把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。
Have answers ready for these popular interview questions:

Tell me a little about yourself./What interests you most about this position?/Where so you see yourself
in 5,10,20 years?/What is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem
that you solved./What are your greatest strengths?/What did you like about your last job?/What separates
you from other candidates?/How do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities
relate to this work?

Most importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. Think about the work you have done, the job you had in
college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. Then proceed to illustrate how you solved a
particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)The problem you encountered,
2)How you analyzed it, and 3)The solution you implemented.

面试中的“陷阱”问题 

序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后
心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”，
那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。
第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的
缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么，
都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性
特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。
如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多
份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢：
“我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。”

The best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. If interviewers walk out after
talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you.
But if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“Hey, I enjoyed that,” that could move you that
much closer to hearing that you got the job.

First is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. The trap question is some
variaton on“ What is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ What is your area of weakness?”
The real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy.
Whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. Instead, try to find something to say that
isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. For example: “I prefer to see a
project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the
finished product. I sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ Sometimes
I have a hard time saying no to people, and I end up taking on more than my share of work.” If you
really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback:
“I’m a perfectionist. I need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure I get everything right. ” 

为何要离开你以前的公司 

对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题
（以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位
上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境
不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。
Be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested
in the new one. These questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new
company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“Why were
you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“It was a hostile environment in which many people were
let go,”is a good way to handle it.

面试难题的应答策略 （上） 
求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。
一、你来这里能干什么？ 
对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略： 
1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。 
2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。 
3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。
4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。 
5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。 
二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？ 

用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略：
1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。
所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因： 
（a）专业对口； 
（b）公司有发展； 
（c）工作环境优越； 
（d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"； 
（e）有更多到外国工作的机会； 
（f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣； 
（g）离家近； 
（h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染） 
2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。 
3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。

面试难题的应答策略 （下） 
三、你自认为有什么优缺点？ 
主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人，
往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出，
那就不适合做某项工作。
答问策略： 
1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这
类问题就不知如何是好了。 
2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个
缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。
3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。 
4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有，
又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己：
对应聘有利的优点：
--好学习、肯钻研。 
--脑子好使，记忆力强。 
--办事认真，一丝不苟。 
--有干劲，不惜力。 
--好相处，跟谁都合得来。 
--有比较丰富的阅历。 
--喜欢接受挑战性的课题。 
--不交女友（男友）不成家。 
对应聘有利的缺点： 
--有名利思想： 
（a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。 
（b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。 
（c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待，
克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。） 
--急脾气 
（a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。 
（b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。 
（c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！ 
--有时主观： 
（a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。 
（b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。 
（c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。 
--不拘小节： 
（a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。 
（b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。 
（c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。） 
--抠门儿、吝啬： 
（a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。 
（b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！
（该人适合管理财务工作）。 
（c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。 
--害羞、胆小： 
（a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。
（该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作） 
（b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。 
（c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。
有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。）
--不顾家： 
（a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。 
（b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。
"所以，我不是一个好丈夫。 
（c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。 
5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。 
四、你善于与什么人相处? 
主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事
沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、
促销等任务。答问策略： 
1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明
你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。 
2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。
所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。 
3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位，
就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。 
4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。 
五、你为什么经常想调动工作？ 
主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因，
是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆
不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略：
1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。 
2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有： 
（a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）； 
（b）跟原单位的领导不和；

这里只是几个常见的英文面试问题，以供参考，多见于外企
What Are Your Weaknesses? 
This is the most dreaded question of all. Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your
strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on
improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.”

Why Should We Hire You? 
Summarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven
record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be
a great addition to your team.”

Why Do You Want to Work Here? 
The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending
out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission
statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does,
and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.” 

What Are Your Goals? 
Sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the
distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term
goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.” 

Why Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job? 
If you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds
of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.”
If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to
look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.” 

When Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job? 
The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project
when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job,
because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.” 

What Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t? 
What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize
concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer
relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102 rmation to be more user-friendly.” 

What Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You? 
It’s time to pull out your old per&＃102 rmance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag
about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever
had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.” 

What Salary Are You Seeking? 
It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in
your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time
comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?” 

If You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be? 
Interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer “a bunny,”
you will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. What type of
personality would it take to get the job done? What impression do you want to make?

Case One 
Interviewer: I'd like to know the salary you expect.
我想了解一下，你期望的薪水是多少？ 
Applicant: My salary requirement may be too high, and I hope my primary will not be lower than RMB 4,000. First, I think I am an excellent graduate. Though there will be a transition period, I will soon make profits for the company. What's more, I think if a company is willing to pay a high salary for a post, it also indicates its importance. And only in this situation can I be convinced that I can get more learning opportunities and better prospects.
我的薪酬要求可能偏高，我希望我的起薪不低于4000元。首先我认为自己是一名优秀的大学毕业生，虽然刚到企业需要一段过渡期，但很快我就能为企业创造价值。而且，我也认为,一个企业如果可以开出较高的薪水，可以证明企业对这个职位的重视度。在这样的情况下，我才有信心能从企业获得更多的学习机会和更好的发展机遇。 
Case Two 
Interviewer: I'd like to know your salary expectations.
我想了解一下，你期望的薪水是多少？ 
Applicant: Since I am a recent graduate , there will be a transition period after I enter the company. So at the beginning, the profits I make for the company will be limited and I don't have specific requirements. But man has to survive. So I hope the salary will be enough to help me to be economically independent from my parents.
因为我是一个刚毕业的大学生，进入企业将有一段时间的适应期，一开始为企业创造的价值有限，所以我对薪金没有特定的要求。但人总是要生存的，所以，我希望我的薪金能够让我独立，在经济上不再依赖父母。 
面试：如何回答工作期望问题工作期望是面试中一个必问问题之一。通常面试官都会问你想从工作中的到什么，或是你三到五年内的计划。那么，该如何回答这样的问题呢？下面两个案例会给你一点启示。 
Case One 
Interviewer: What do you want most from your work?
你最希望从工作中得到什么? 
Applicant: I hope to get a kind of learning, to get skills from my work. Though I have studied in school for nearly 16 years, I have only learned knowledge. In the university, I got no chance to see real life and didn\'t get working skills. So I want to learn some working skills and become a professional in an industry.
我最希望得到的是一种学习，能让我学到工作的技能。虽然我已经在学校学习了快16年,但只是学习到了知识，在学校里，没有机会接触到真正的社会，没有掌握一项工作技能，所以我最希望获得一项工作的技能，能够成为某一个行业领域的专业人士。 
Interviewer: Why did you choose us?
你为什么选择到我们公司来应聘? 

Applicant: As the saying goes, "well begun is half done". Your company is a famous one in the industry and boasts a high reputation. I hope to choose your company as the beginning of my career. I can not only learn new things, but set a solid foundation for my future career as well.
俗话说"良好的开端是成功的一半"。贵公司是行业内的知名公司，享有很高的声誉。我希望选择贵公司作为事业的开端，不仅可以学到新东西，而且为我将来的发展打下良好的基础。 
Case Two 
Interviewer: What do you hope this job will give you?
你最希望这份工作给予你什么? 
Applicant: I hope this job will give me a chance to take responsibility. In more than ten years' of study as a student, I have never taken any responsibility in any real sense or earned money for a company. I think people can only become mature by taking on responsibility. I hope this work will give me the chance to develop fully.
我希望这份工作可以给我一个承担职责的机会。在过去十几年的学习生涯中，作为一名学生，我从来没有在真正意义上承担过责任，为一个企业盈利。我认为，人是通过承担一定的责任才能成长、成熟的，我希望这份工作能够给予我发展的机会。 
以上例子从学习和承担职责的角度出发，都十分注重能力的培养，这会让面试官觉得求职者不是一个功利心很强的人，给面试官留下好印象。 
面试：如何应对角色扮演的问题
角色扮演是各大外企招聘时经常采用的方式之一。回答这类问题的要点是应聘者一定要设身处地、把自己当作角色中的人物。另外，基于任何角色提出的问题根本的目的是要考察应聘者对公司的态度，所以在角色扮演时，要把自己想象成该角色，也要站在全公司的角度来考虑问题，所谓大处着眼、小处着手，方能立于不败之地。 
Case One 
Interviewer: You are a director of our company and you are in charge of a project. There are six people in the project team. Due to different opinions, the team is split into two parts at a meeting and they are debating ferociously. At this time, as a leader, what will you do to coordinate the two parts? If the two parts disagree, what will you do then?
如果你已经成为我公司的一名主管，由你负责管理一个项目。在该项目的团队中一共有六个人。在一次会议上，由于观点不同，团队分成两派，,进行了激烈的争论，这时，你作为领导者该如何协调？如果两方不能达成共识，你又会怎么办？ 
Applicant: First, I will listen to both sides carefully, and make my own judgment. If I prefer one side, I will give facts and data to persuade the other side. If my opinion is between the two sides, I will also give facts and data to prove my opinion right. It is better that the two sides will agree on it. If not, I will stick to my opinion and allow the colleagues who keep reserved opinions to give more data and communicate with me. In short, my principle is that everything should be based on data and facts. Every colleague has the right to express his opinion. I will try my best to make all people agree on one thing. If I fail, I will make my decision, as a leader.
首先我会仔细聆听双方的观点和理由，并作出我的判断。如果我倾向于其中一方的观点，我会拿出数据和事实来说服另一方；如果我的观点是介于两者之间，我同样会基于数据和事实来证明我的立场。如果最后大家能够达成共识自然最好。如果不能，我会坚持我的观点，但允许持保留意见的同事拿出更多的数据来和我沟通。总之，我的原则是，用数据和事实说话，每一位同事都有权表达他的观点，我会尽量让大家达成共识。如果不行，那作为领导者，我会做出一个决定。 
点评：该求职者能够基于数据和事实说话，既不是独断专行，也不做和事老，这充分表现了他处理问题的成熟程度。 
Case Two 
Interviewer: You are now a team member and if your leader has made a decision but you don't quite agree with this decision and other members don't express any special opinions, what will you do?
如果你现在是一个项目的团队成员，如果你的领导已经作出了一个决定，但你个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，那你会怎么做？ 
Applicant: If my leader has made a decision, but I myself don't quite agree with this decision and other members don't express any special opinion, I will still express my opinion. If the leader doesn't agree with me, I will make my own judgment. If this decision isn't very important, then as a team member, I will act according to what the leader has decided. If this is a key decision, I will gather related information to support my view and try to persuade my leader.
如果我的领导已经做出了一个决定，但我个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，这时候问我仍然会提出我的意见。如果领导不同意，那我会做出自己的判断。如果我们这个决定并不是十分重要的，那么作为团队成员，我会遵照领导的决定来执行；如果是一个关键的决定，我会搜集相关的材料为我自己的观点寻找支持，力求说服领导。 
点评：虽然只是一个团队成员，但该求职者仍然能够大胆地提出自己地意见，并且能够就问题做出理性的判断，能够让面试官觉得该求职者是真正站在公司的立场上看待问题，并且体现了他处理问题的成熟性。

到外企应聘如何准备英文RESUME
一份出色的Resume，是向外企求职的关键之一。不了解有关的常识和程式，不花费相当的心思来展示，以有纯正娴熟的英文功底，决不能获得单位的青睐。在一大堆错误百出、英文表达能力低劣或平庸，毫无针对性和创造性的Resume中，你的那份若能让人眼睛一亮，成功的机会必将大大增加，以下试着结合一个具体的例子给出说明和评述。
Balance Sheet：
基本方法选取适当的工作后，必须看清招聘广告上所列出的每项要求，再将自己的学历、能力与兴趣逐一与之比较，作一张balance sheet.
例如，一则关于marketing management trainee和job requirement是这样写的：
We are looking for a competent person to fill the captioned position：
University graduate majors in Marketing Management. Prepared to develop career in the commercial field
-outgoing personality
-Able to communicate with different levels
-Good knowledge in PC operations -Proficiency in written and spoken English/Mandarin
则你相应地考虑自己的qualification的选择和表述，如你可写（与上列各项对应）：
-University graduate with major in Marketing
-Having actively participated in Business club‘s activities and learned accounting and management
-Good in communication with people and like a lot of out door activities know how to tackle with people from all walks of life
-Skillful in operating Words,Excel,Lotus1-2-3,etc
-Fluent in English and studied advanced level of Mandarin
这个方法的好处是可让求职者清楚了解该职位是否适合自己，而本身资料又是否切合要求，而且，明白了各项要求后，就可依据每一点在履历表上重点提出自己在该方面的强项。突出卖点(selling point)，将之放在最吸引别人的地方，使招聘者一眼可见，有利于present自己。
工作经验的陈述
工作经验是一份resume中令招聘者相当感兴趣的一项内容，善加措词是必不可忽视的要务。
刚毕业，何来工作经验？其实，客下读书时的兼职、实习、实践，以至所曾参加的一些课外活动－协助助出版学校刊物、举办活动，展览、宣传……都可算是工作经验、不过，表达起来要有针对性地展开，列出那些与所找工作有关连的项目重点介绍，必要时更可使用summary的方式，给招聘者深入的了解。
下面这份材料的相关表这实在简陋呆板：
1996/7-1996/8 General Clerk, IBM
1995/7-1995/8 Account clerks, Manley Toy Trading
1994/6-1994/8Salesgirl,Esprit.
倘能换一种表述如：
Three years of job experience in different positions have offered me opportunities to understand different job aspects.
-As a General Clerk(IBM),Accounts clerk (Manley Toy Trading),I have learned how to prepare purchasing orders, place orders, handle accounting mattery, check voucher,……also(Salesgirl, Esprin)developing the technique of sellina, serving and 
stocking.
岂非能更好地突出个人工作经验，吸引招聘者的注意力！
Job Objective通常，一般求者只会在履历表开端简单地写上所应征的职位－"Position Applied: Management Trainee"或"I am appling for……"其实，若懂得利用这小小空间写出自己的事业目标（job objective），能显示出你对该工作的热诚及憧憬，能令招聘者对你加倍留意。
比如这个不错的例子job objective To begin as a Marketing Management Trainee, with opportunity to advance to executive level and contribute to the development of firm.
其实，这位外企人士所谈的关于准备RESUME的技巧，完全可以应用到中文简历上来。各位读者可以尝试一下。 

求职面试的技巧
Tricks in Job Hunting Interview
Here are good answers to some of the tougher questions asked in job interviews. If you can smoothly supply answers like these during the interview, you are bound to make a good impression.
### What is important to you in a job?
Mention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, the feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.
### Why do you want to work for this organization? 
Cite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working conditions. Stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organization.
### Why should we employ you? 
Point to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm. Mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. If the job involves management responsibilities, refer to past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team.
### If we hire you, how long will you stay with us? 
Answer by saying along these lines: "As long as my position here allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities."
### Can we offer you a career path?
Reply: "I believe you could, once I know the normal progression within the organization. Can you tell me about it?" The answer may be revealing.
### What are your greatest strengths?
Give a response like one of the following: "I can see what needs to be done and do it", "I'm wiling to make decisions", "I work well with others," "I can organize my time efficiently."
### What are you greatest weakness?
Identify one or two, such as the following:" I tend to drive myself too hard", " I expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " I like to see a job done quickly, and I'm critical if it isn't." Note these weaknesses could also be regarded as desirable qualities. The trick with this question is to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.
### What didn't you like about previous jobs you've held?
Discuss the things you didn't like, but avoid making slighting reference to any of your former employers.
### How do you spend your leisure time?
Mention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.
### Are there any weaknesses in your education or experience? 
Take stock of your weaknesses before the interview. Practice discussing them in a positive light. You'll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer.
1### Where do you want to be five years from now?
Saying that you'd like to be president is unrealistic, yet few employers want people who are content to sit still. You might say, "in five years, I'd like to have my boss's job. " If you can't qualify for your boss's job by then, you may not be the fright candidate.
1### What are your salary expectations?
If you are asked this at the outset, it's best to say, "Why don't we discuss salary after you decide whether I'm right for the job? "But if the interviewer asks this after showing real interest in you, speak up. She or he will probably try to meet your price. If you need a clue about what to ask for, say, " Can you discuss your salary range with me?"
1### What would you do if....?
This question is designed to test your reposes. For example: "What would you do if your computer broke down during an audit?" Your answer there isn't nearly so important as your approach to the problem. And a calm approach is best. Start by saying, "One thing I might do is ..." Then give several alternative choices.
1### What type of position are you interested in? 
Job titles and responsibilities vary from firm to firm . So state your skills instead, such as "I'm good at figure work," and the positions that require these skills , such as "accounts payable."
1### Tell me something about yourself.
Say you'll be happy to talk about yourself, and ask what the interviewer wants to know. If this point is clarified, respond. If not, tell why you feel your skills will contribute to the job and the organization. This question gives you a great opportunity to sell yourself.
1### Do you have any questions about the organization or the job?
Employers like a candidate who is interested in the organization. so this is a perfect time to convey your interest and enthusiasm. 

面试的最后需要做些什么?
关于真正的面试最后要提醒的是：结束面试时要说：“我对这份工作非常感兴趣，我下一步要干些什么？”朋友，你是否在热切地盼望着？如果聘用你，那将是他们的幸运！
One last great tip about the actual interview: Always end the interview with, “I am very interested in the position. What are the next steps to take?” Boy, are you eager? They’d be lucky to have you!
准备好你要提出的问题 
在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先，不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。这里有风个备选问题：
请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？
考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。
Have questions of your own. Toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” Do you have any questions for me? You must have questions. First, don’t rush into your answer. Look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. Here is a handful of potential questions:
How would you describe a typical workday?/What is the best part of working at this company for you? /Are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/Why did you join the company?
Interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.

常见问题做好准备 
针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案：
谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？/ 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历和大学活动与这份工作有何关联?
最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职，参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。
Have answers ready for these popular interview questions:
Tell me a little about yourself./What interests you most about this position?/Where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/What is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./What are your greatest strengths?/What did you like about your last job?/What separates you from other candidates?/How do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work? 
Most importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. Think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. Then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)The problem you encountered,2)How you analyzed it, and 3)The solution you implemented.

面试中的“陷阱”问题 
序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”，那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。
第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么，都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢：“我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。”
The best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. If interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. But if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“Hey, I enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.

First is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. The trap question is some variaton on“ What is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ What is your area of weakness?” The real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. Whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. Instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. For example: “I prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. I sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ Sometimes I have a hard time saying no to people, and I end up taking on more than my share of work.” If you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “I’m a perfectionist. I need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure I get everything right. ” 

为何要离开你以前的公司 
对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题（以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。
Be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. These questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“Why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“It was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.

面试难题的应答策略
求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。 
一、你来这里能干什么？ 
对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略： 
1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。 
2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。 
3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。 
4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。 
5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。 
二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？ 
用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略： 
1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因： 
（a）专业对口； 
（b）公司有发展； 
（c）工作环境优越； 
（d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"； 
（e）有更多到外国工作的机会； 
（f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣； 
（g）离家近； 
（h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染） 
2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。 
3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。

面试难题的应答策略 （下） 
三、你自认为有什么优缺点？ 
主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人，往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出，那就不适合做某项工作。
答问策略： 
1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这类问题就不知如何是好了。 
2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。 
3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。 
4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有，又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己： 
对应聘有利的优点： 
--好学习、肯钻研。 
--脑子好使，记忆力强。 
--办事认真，一丝不苟。 
--有干劲，不惜力。 
--好相处，跟谁都合得来。 
--有比较丰富的阅历。 
--喜欢接受挑战性的课题。 
--不交女友（男友）不成家。 
对应聘有利的缺点： 
--有名利思想： 
（a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。 
（b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。 
（c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待，克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。） 
--急脾气 
（a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。 
（b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。 
（c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！ 
--有时主观： 
（a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。 
（b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。 
（c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。 
--不拘小节： 
（a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。 
（b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。 
（c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。） 
--抠门儿、吝啬： 
（a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。 
（b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！（该人适合管理财务工作）。 
（c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。 
--害羞、胆小： 
（a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。（该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作） 
（b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。 
（c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。） 
--不顾家： 
（a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。 
（b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。"所以，我不是一个好丈夫。 
（c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。 
5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。 
四、你善于与什么人相处? 
主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、促销等任务。答问策略： 
1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。 
2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。 
3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位，就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。 
4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。 
五、你为什么经常想调动工作？ 
主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因，是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略： 
1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。 
2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有： 
（a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）； 
（b）跟原单位的领导不和； 
（c）想多挣钱； 
（d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。 
3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）： 
（a）能实现个人的抱负； 
（b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展； 
（c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。 

常见的英文面试问题，多见于外企
What Are Your Weaknesses? 
This is the most dreaded question of all. Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.” 
Why Should We Hire You? 
Summarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be a great addition to your team.” 
Why Do You Want to Work Here? 
The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.” 
What Are Your Goals? 
Sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.” 
Why Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job? 
If you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.” 
If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.” 
When Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job? 
The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.” 
What Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t? 
What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102;ormation to be more user-friendly.” 
What Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You? 
It’s time to pull out your old per&＃102;ormance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.” 
What Salary Are You Seeking? 
It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?” 
If You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be? 
Interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get the job done? What impression do you want to make? 

英文简历攻略 
经常看到有人发翻译简历的贴子。其实我个人认为简历的翻译并没有定式，可自由发挥。但是有一个原则关系到别人看了你的英文简历后对你的英文水平的第一印象，那就是简历中地用词，句子，表达方式等一定要地道。也就是说不能带有太多的所谓中式英语，让别人一看就觉得很不爽。最近我有幸得到一些老外（包括非英语国家）的简历，看了以后颇有收获，拿来共享心得。题目虽然是《完全攻略》，但时间仓促，难免有理解错误，或者不完整的地方还希望大家指正，补充。总的来说，看完这些英文简历给我的感觉是：与其把中文简历翻译成英文，还不如用英文再写一个简历。这样完全按照英文的思维方式和习惯作为出发点写出的简历才会更地道。
一、简历的结构
首先，整个简历要分成若干部分：基本情况、自我介绍、教育经历、工作经历等等。这些部分如何分完全凭自己掌握。但是有些不内容是必不可少的。下面就列出我在这些简历上看到的栏目：
我注意到大部分简历的最上方（标题的位置）都是求职者的姓名和联系方式。也有某些简历用名字作为标题，然后下面的位置写上了自己的求职意向或者联系方式。而有些则是把联系方式做成页眉的效果。和这种方式能让阅读者对此人的姓名联系方式和求职意向一目了然，可以提高效率，并且对求职者有比较深刻的印象。由此可见她们的共同点是：大多以姓名作为大标题，然后再显眼的地方注明联系方式和求职意向。
接下来算是简历的正文。所有的简历都把教育经历放在首位。看来教育背景还是对方关注的首要问题。教育背景是按照时间倒序排列的，最近的放在最上面。有的是时间写在前面，紧跟学校、专业作为条目的标题，或者把学校、专业放前面，后面跟时间。标题下面是具体的介绍。
然后是工作经历，格式和教育背景基本一致。某些简历在教育背景和工作经历之间还加上了学过的和专业相关的课程，培训班等。而在工经理后面还可以加上参加过的志愿者工作等。
以上是简历中的重头戏。接下来的内容大多是自己掌握的技能，语言能力和计算机能力。有时还有个人爱好等更全面介绍自己的内容。
二、简历的用词翻译
下面列出一些中英文对照（有的地方可以用多个英文单词表示，用 '|' 隔开，这里列出的只是简历中出现的，也许并不仅限于这些）：
求职意向 ------- Objective
Objective这个词在电脑游戏中出现的频率很高。一般是作为每关之前的任务介绍。直译就是目标、目的。如果有Objective，一般放在正文的第一栏。
教育背景 --------Education | Education and Qualifications
都用这个，background就不要加上了，有点中式英语的嫌疑。如果包含了一些认证培训之类的，可以写成 Education and Qualifications.
个人介绍、自我评价 -------- PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS | SYNOPSIS
SYNOPSIS这个词比较笼统，内容可以自由些，包括个人性格，目前状况等。
PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS 偏重于介绍自己的优势、优点等。
工作经历 ---------- Experience | Work(ing) Experience | JOB EXPERIENCE | EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE
这些都是大同小异。也有个人用 EMPLOYMENT HIGHLIGHTS。 
我注意到有个人在Work Experience 的位置用了 Research Experience， 再细看内容才发现此人的经历都是研究性质的工作，包括在大学期间从事的一些研究。
参加过的活动（包括校内） -------------- ACTIVITIES
ACTIVITIES最普遍，所有的活动都包括了，比较好用。
Campus Involvement & Activities 这里加上compus 那就仅限于在学校的。这里的 Involvement 我猜想指的是参加社团或者某个组织的这种长期的活动。而Activities则不限。
荣誉、奖励 -------- Honors | Awards
有些干脆就用 Honors & Awards
剩下的一些
技能 ---- Skills | Additional Skills
爱好 ----- HOBBIES
计算机技能 ------ Computer Skills 也可以作为Skills的一部分。
志愿者经历 ----- VOLUNTEERING
接下来介绍一下具体内容的翻译。
流利使用某种语言： Fluent in XXX
普通话： Mandarin Chinese
熟悉......：Familiar with....
精通.... ：proficient with | Advanced Skills in.... | Advanced Software User： （列出精通使用的软件名称）
个人、人： individual （注意不要用person什么的）
关于语言能力的： Daily Spoken （经常使用的）， Training Obtained（受过培训的---我想不仅限于语言能力）

三、总结
这些简历给我的最大感受是，简练。没有废话，有些地方甚至省略掉主语例如： Activities: President of College Democrats，中文简历中一般会说“曾担任校学生会主席”，而你要死板的翻译成英文就很罗嗦：“ I've been the President of the Students' Union of the college” ，不如就说 “President of the Students' Union ”，能简单尽量简单，至于是校学生会，还是系学生会不必在乎，再说真的在乎的话面试的时候有机会的。而且语言简练不容易出错，何乐而不为。
在碰到一些不太好翻译的词汇时，不用着急，可以自己创造，只要能正确表达出中文词汇的含义即可。毕竟两种语言之间不是映射表的关系。
我看到一份简历在Education后面还加上了，Double Majors 和 Higher Level Course Work， 这样把突出的教育经历或者工作经历单独列出来，容易引起关注，是个好方法。
总之，要做到简练，结构清楚，表达明确，不出现错误，就是一个合格的英文简历。

英文求职信七步写作法 
求职信分为推荐信和自荐信两种，它是书面表达的重要体裁之一，也是高考书面表达的热点内容。写求职信可按下列七个步骤进行。下面举例说明：
假设你叫李平，你从报上得知某公司欲招聘一名英语翻译，请你给该公司经理写一份求职信，你的个人资料如下：
1.简况：姓名，李平；年龄，30岁；身高，1.80米；健康状况，良好；业余爱好，游泳、唱歌、跳舞。
2.简历：1994年北京大学毕业后分配到南通中学工作，1996年调至苏州中学工作至今。
3.工作：工作认真负责，与人相处融洽。
4.特长：精通英语，尤其口语，已将多本中文书籍译成英语，懂一些日语、能用日语与外宾对话。
联系电话：3654 7557
联系地址：苏州市人民路75号

第一步：介绍消息来源
介绍消息来源实际上是求职信的开篇交待句，它可使求职信显得自然、顺畅；而不介绍消息来源，会使收信人感到意外、突然，文章也缺乏过渡、照应，本文消息来源可作如下介绍：
Dear manager, 
I learned from the newspaper that your company wanted to hire an English translator.

第二步：表明求职心愿
介绍完消息来源后，应向收信人表明自己的求职心愿，即写信的目的，本文求职心愿可作如下介绍：
I'm interested in this job very much. I'd like to get this job. 

第三步：介绍个人简历
某单位需要新人，求职人也有求职心愿，但这并不意味着这项工作非你莫属。如果你没有干好这项工作的经历、实力，也是难以适应的。因此，介绍个人简历是必不可少的。本文个人简历可介绍如下：
Now I'd like to introduce myself to you. My name is Li Ping. I'm 30 years old. I'm 180 cm tall. I'm healthy. I like swimming, singing and dancing in my spare time. I graduated from Beijing University in 1994.Then,I went to work in Nantong Middle School.In 1996，I began to work in Suzhou Middle School and I have worked there until now.
第四步：摆出求职优势
仅有一定的工作经历而没有自身的优势和特长，也很难求得称心如意的工作。因此，求职时应表明自己除了具有一定的工作经历之外，还具有一定的优势和特长，这样才能稳操胜券。本文可通过如下方法摆出自己的优势：
I work hard and I can get along well with others. I'm good at English and especially my spoken English is very good. I've translated many Chinese books into English. I can understand Japanese and I can talk to foreigners in Japanese freely. 


第五步：提出获职打算
丰富的工作经验，一定的优势和特长，只能代表过去和现在的情况，如果获职后自以为心愿已了，从此高枕无忧，马虎从事，那也是得不到用人单位认可的。显然表明获职后努力工作的决心是感动用人单位的领导从而顺利谋得此项工作的重要一环。本文获职打算可作如下介绍：
If you agree with me, I'll work hard and try to be a good translator. 
第六步：请求答复联系
如果单位领导同意了你的求职要求，你必然要请他和你联系，以便你及时做好准备，到用人单位应聘或报到。为准确起见，请求答复联系时你还应当提供你的通讯地址、邮政编码、电话号码、电子信箱等。本文答复联系的内容可作如下介绍：
If you agree with me, please write a letter to me or phone me. I live at No.1 Renmin Road,Suzhou city. My telephone number is 365437### 
第七步：表明感激之情
无论你的请求是否能够得到满意的答复，你给用人单位写信就是给对方添了麻烦，因此你应向对方表明感激之情。本文可这样来表明感激之情：
Thank you very much.
上述七步内容联成一个整体，再加上下面的信尾，就成为一封完整的求职信。
Yours Truly
LiPing
