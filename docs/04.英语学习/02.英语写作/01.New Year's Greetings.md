Looking back on 2022, it is not a smooth year. In the past year, our country has encountered many difficulties, and most of the people’s work and life have not been carried out smoothly. The COVID-19 is capricious, and the dynamic zero clearing policy is difficult. To sum up, the three-year fight against the epidemic has left us with too many bad memories, which has left us exhausted physically and mentally, the national finace unable to make ends meet, and grass-roots organizations have been working under high pressure and high load for a long time. But please don’t lose confidence in the future and life. After all, under the leadership of the CPC, we have always been one of the most successful countries in combating COVID-19. The development of history has constantly told us that, with confidence, adhering to principle of representing the advanced productive forces and the most fundamental interests of the people has always been a magic weapon for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the new era of the world.



2023 is the first year of full liberalization of the epidemic. Let’s forget the pain of 2022, always remember the significant historical achievements we have made since 1949, and look forward to the future with unlimited development potential.



At the same time, I hope you will remember to prepare some medicine, masks and other necessary materials commonly used in illness after the recovery of drug supply, wear masks when going out, pay attention to protection, protect the most important people around, and be the first responsible person for your health. In the new year, let’s work together to create a brilliant 2023 and contribute to the grand vision of 2035. We wish the motherland an early reunification, achieve common prosperity in advance and return to the top of the world.



Long live the people.

时间过得很快，是时候对2022年说再见，迎接新的2023年了。
回首2022，是相当不容易的一年。在过去的一年里，我们的国家遭遇了很多困难，而人民群众们，大多数工作生活开展的也并不顺利。新冠疫情反复无常，动态清零方针困难重重。总结下来，三年的抗击疫情，让大家身心俱疲、国家财政入不敷出、基层组织长期保持高压高负荷的工作状态，难以为继、大量企业破产倒闭，这给我们留下了太多不好的回忆。但请大家不要失去对未来以及对生活的信心，毕竟在中国共产党的领导下，我们始终是抗击新冠疫情最成功的国家之一。历史的发展在不断的告诉我们，满怀信心，坚持代表先进生产力、坚持代表广大人民群众最根本利益的方针，始终是新时代世界格局下复兴中华民族的法宝。

2023年是疫情全面放开的第一年，让我们暂时忘记2022的伤痛，心中始终铭着自1949年以来，我们所取得的重大历史成果，展望无限发展潜能的未来。

同时希望大家在供药品供给恢复后，记得准备一些生病常用的药和口罩等必要物资，出门在外全程戴好口罩，注意防护，保护好身边最重要的人，做好自己健康的第一责任人。新的一年，让我们一起努力，共创辉煌2023，为2035的宏伟愿景添砖加瓦，祝愿祖国早日统一，提前实现共同富裕，重回世界之巅。

人民万岁
