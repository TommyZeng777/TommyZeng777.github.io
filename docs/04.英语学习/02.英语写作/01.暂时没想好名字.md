Looking back on 2022, it is not a smooth year. In the past year, our country has encountered many difficulties, and most of the people’s work and life have not been carried out smoothly. The COVID-19 is capricious, and the dynamic zero clearing policy is difficult. To sum up, the three-year fight against the epidemic has left us with too many bad memories, which has left us exhausted physically and mentally, the national finace unable to make ends meet, and grass-roots organizations have been working under high pressure and high load for a long time. But please don’t lose confidence in the future and life. After all, under the leadership of the CPC, we have always been one of the most successful countries in combating COVID-19. The development of history has constantly told us that, with confidence, adhering to principle of representing the advanced productive forces and the most fundamental interests of the people has always been a magic weapon for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the new era of the world.



2023 is the first year of full liberalization of the epidemic. Let’s forget the pain of 2022, always remember the significant historical achievements we have made since 1949, and look forward to the future with unlimited development potential.



At the same time, I hope you will remember to prepare some medicine, masks and other necessary materials commonly used in illness after the recovery of drug supply, wear masks when going out, pay attention to protection, protect the most important people around, and be the first responsible person for your health. In the new year, let’s work together to create a brilliant 2023 and contribute to the grand vision of 2035. We wish the motherland an early reunification, achieve common prosperity in advance and return to the top of the world.



Long live the people.
