The line graph compares average yearly spending by Americans on mobile and landline phone services from 2001 to 2010.<!--more-->

折线图比较了2001年至2010年间美国人在移动电话和固定电话服务上的平均年度支出。

It is clear that spending on landline phones fell steadily over the 10-year period, while mobile phone expenditure rose quickly. The year 2006 marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.

很明显，在这10年间，固定电话的支出稳步下降，而移动电话的支出迅速增加。2006年是移动服务支出超过住宅电话服务支出的时间点。

In 2001, US consumers spent an average of nearly `$`700 on residential phone services, compared to only around `$`200 on cell phone services. Over the following five years, average yearly spending on landlines dropped by nearly `$`200. By contrast, expenditure on mobiles rose by approximately `$`300.

2001年，美国消费者在住宅电话服务上的平均支出接近700美元，而在手机服务上的支出仅约200美元。在接下来的五年里，固定电话的平均年度支出减少了近200美元。相比之下，移动电话的支出增加了约300美元。

In the year 2006, the average American paid out the same amount of money on both types of phone service, spending just over `$`500 on each. By 2010, expenditure on mobile phones had reached around `$`750, while the figure for spending on residential services had fallen to just over half this amount.

2006年，美国人在这两种电话服务上的支出金额相同，每种支出刚超过500美元。到2010年，手机支出达到约750美元，而住宅服务的支出则降至此数额的一半多一点。

The diagram illustrates the various stages in the life of a honey bee. We can see that the complete life cycle lasts between 34 and 36 days. It is also noticeable that there are five main stages in the development of the honey bee, from egg to mature adult insect.

图表展示了蜜蜂生命周期的各个阶段。可以看出，蜜蜂的完整生命周期持续34至36天。同样值得注意的是，蜜蜂的发展从卵到成熟成虫共有五个主要阶段。

The life cycle of the honey bee begins when the female adult lays an egg; the female typically lays one or two eggs every 3 days. Between 9 and 10 days later, each egg hatches and the immature insect, or nymph, appears.

蜜蜂的生命周期开始于成年雌蜂产卵；雌蜂通常每3天产一到两个卵。在9到10天后，每个卵孵化，出现幼虫（若虫）。

During the third stage of the life cycle, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin three times. This moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days later, and again another 9 days later. After a total of 30 to 31 days from the start of the cycle, the young adult honey bee emerges from its final moulting stage, and in the space of only 4 days it reaches full maturity.

在生命周期的第三阶段，若虫体积增大并蜕皮三次。第一次蜕皮发生在卵孵化后5天，然后是7天后，再次是再过9天。从周期开始后总共30到31天，年轻的成年蜜蜂从最后一次蜕皮阶段出现，在短短4天内达到完全成熟。

The chart compares average figures for temperature and precipitation over the course of a calendar year in Kolkata. It is noticeable that monthly figures for precipitation in Kolkata vary considerably, whereas monthly temperatures remain relatively stable. Rainfall is highest from July to August, while temperatures are highest in April and May.

该图表比较了加尔各答一年中的平均温度和降水量。值得注意的是，加尔各答的月降水量变化较大，而月温度相对稳定。降雨量在7月到8月最高，而温度在4月和5月最高。

Between the months of January and May, average temperatures in Kolkata rise from their lowest point at around 20°C to a peak of just over 30°C. Average rainfall in the city also rises over the same period, from approximately 20mm of rain in January to 100mm in May.

在1月至5月期间，加尔各答的平均温度从最低点约20°C上升到刚刚超过30°C的高点。同期，城市的平均降雨量也从1月的约20毫米上升到5月的100毫米。

While temperatures stay roughly the same for the next four months, the amount of rainfall more than doubles between May and June. Figures for precipitation remain above 250mm from June to September, peaking at around 330mm in July. The final three months of the year see a dramatic fall in precipitation, to a low of about 10mm in December, and a steady drop in temperatures back to the January average.

尽管接下来四个月的温度大致相同，但5月到6月间的降雨量增加了一倍以上。6月至9月的降水量保持在250毫米以上，7月达到约330毫米的高峰。年底最后三个月降水量急剧下降，到12月降至约10毫米，并且温度稳步回落至1月的平均水平。

The bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of why they are studying and whether they are supported by an employer.

条形图比较了不同年龄的学生在为什么学习以及是否得到雇主支持方面的差异。

It is clear that the proportion of students who study for career purposes is far higher among the younger age groups, while the oldest students are more likely to study for interest. Employer support is more commonly given to younger students.

显然，为职业目的学习的学生比例在年轻年龄组中远高于其他组，而最年长的学生更可能因兴趣而学习。雇主的支持更多地给予年轻学生。

Around 80% of students aged under 26 study to further their careers, whereas only 10% study purely out of interest. The gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those in their forties are the same, at about 40%. Students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%) rather than for professional reasons (less than 20%).

大约80%的26岁以下学生为了进一步发展其职业而学习，而只有10%的学生纯粹出于兴趣而学习。这两个比例之间的差距随着学生年龄的增长而缩小，四十多岁的学生比例相同，约为40%。49岁以上的学生绝大多数是因兴趣（70%）而非职业原因（少于20%）而学习。

Just over 60% of students aged under 26 are supported by their employers. By contrast, the 30-39 age group is the most self-sufficient, with only 30% being given time off and help with fees. The figures rise slightly for students in their forties and for those aged 50 or more.

超过60%的26岁以下学生得到了雇主的支持。相比之下，30-39岁的年龄组最为自给自足，只有30%的人获得了休假和费用帮助。四十多岁的学生和50岁以上的学生的数字略有上升。

The bar chart compares the number of incidents and injuries for every 100 million passenger miles traveled on five different types of public transport in 2002.

条形图比较了2002年五种不同公共交通方式每一亿乘客英里旅行中发生的事故和伤害数量。

It is clear that the most incidents and injuries took place on demand-response vehicles. By contrast, commuter rail services recorded by far the lowest figures.

很明显，需求响应型车辆发生了最多的事故和伤害。相比之下，通勤铁路服务的数字远远最低。

A total of 225 incidents and 173 injuries, per 100 million passenger miles traveled, took place on demand-response transport services. These figures were nearly three times as high as those for the second highest category, bus services. There were 76 incidents and 66 people were injured on buses.

在需求响应型交通服务上，每一亿乘客英里旅行中共发生了225起事故和173起伤害。这些数字几乎是第二高类别，即公交服务数字的三倍。公交车上发生了76起事故，66人受伤。

Rail services experienced fewer problems. The number of incidents on light rail trains equaled the figure recorded for buses, but there were significantly fewer injuries, at only 39. Heavy rail services saw lower numbers of such events than light rail services, but commuter rail passengers were even less likely to experience problems. In fact, only 20 incidents and 17 injuries occurred on commuter trains.

铁路服务遇到的问题较少。轻轨列车的事故数量与公交车记录的数字相等，但受伤人数显著较少，仅为39人。重轨服务的此类事件数量低于轻轨服务，但通勤铁路乘客遇到问题的可能性更小。实际上，通勤列车仅发生了20起事故和17起伤害。

The line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65 or more in three countries over a period of 100 years. It is clear that the proportion of elderly people increases in each country between 1940 and 2040. Japan is expected to see the most dramatic changes in its elderly population.

折线图比较了三个国家中65岁及以上人口的百分比，时间跨度为100年。很明显，在1940年到2040年间，每个国家的老年人口比例都在增加。预计日本在老年人口中将看到最剧烈的变化。

In 1940, around 9% of Americans were aged 65 or over, compared to about 7% of Swedish people and 5% of Japanese people. The proportions of elderly people in the USA and Sweden rose gradually over the next 50 years, reaching just under 15% in 1990. By contrast, the figures for Japan remained below 5% until the early 2000s.

1940年，大约9%的美国人年龄在65岁以上，相比之下，约7%的瑞典人和5%的日本人。在接下来的50年里，美国和瑞典的老年人口比例逐渐上升，到1990年接近15%。相比之下，日本的数据直到21世纪初仍然低于5%。

Looking into the future, a sudden increase in the percentage of elderly people is predicted for Japan, with a jump of over 15% in just 10 years from 2030 to 2040. By 2040, it is thought that around 27% of the Japanese population will be 65 years old or more, while the figures for Sweden and the USA will be slightly lower, at about 25% and 23% respectively.

展望未来，预计日本的老年人口比例将突然增加，在2030年到2040年的10年间增加超过15%。预计到2040年，约27%的日本人将年满65岁或以上，而瑞典和美国的数据将略低，分别约为25%和23%。

The table shows percentages of consumer expenditure for three categories of products and services in five countries in 2002.

该表显示了2002年五个国家在三类产品和服务上的消费支出百分比。

It is clear that the largest proportion of consumer spending in each country went on food, drinks, and tobacco. On the other hand, the leisure/education category has the lowest percentages in the table. Out of the five countries, consumer spending on food, drinks, and tobacco was noticeably higher in Turkey, at 32.14%, and Ireland, at nearly 29%. The proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in Turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in Italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.

很明显，每个国家的消费支出中食品、饮料和烟草的比例最大。另一方面，休闲/教育类别在表中的百分比最低。在这五个国家中，土耳其和爱尔兰在食品、饮料和烟草上的消费支出明显较高，分别为32.14%和近29%。在休闲和教育方面的支出比例，土耳其也是最高的，为4.35%，而意大利在服装和鞋类的支出上明显高于其他国家，为9%。

It can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively. Spain had slightly higher figures for these categories, but the lowest figure for leisure/education, at only 1.98%.

可以看出，瑞典在食品/饮料/烟草和服装/鞋类的国民消费支出百分比最低，分别为近16%和略高于5%。西班牙在这些类别的数字略高，但在休闲/教育方面的数字最低，仅为1.98%。

The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

It is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo. 

In 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³. 

In the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.

The bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over aperiod of 13 years from 1989. 
We can see that house prices fell overall between 1990 and 1995, but most of the cities saw rising prices between 1996 and 2002. London experienced by far the greatest changes in house prices over the 13-year period. 

Over the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in Tokyo and London dropped by around 7%, while New York house prices went down by 5%. By contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both Madrid and Frankfurt. 

Between 1996 and 2002, London house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. Homebuyers in New York also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in Tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. The cost of an average home in Madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in Frankfurt remained stable.

It is noticeable that levels of poverty were higher for single people than for couples, and people with children were more likely to be poor than those without. Poverty rates were considerably lower among elderly people. 

Overall, 11% of Australians, or 1,837,000 people, were living in poverty in 1999. Aged people were the least likely to be poor, with poverty levels of 6% and 4% for single aged people and aged couples respectively. 

Just over one fifth of single parents were living in poverty, whereas only 12% of parents living with a partner were classed as poor. The same pattern can be seen for people with no children: while 19% of single people in this group were living below the poverty line, the figure for couples was much lower, at only 7%.

The main difference between the two sites is that S1 is outside the town, whereas S2 is in the town centre. The sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns. 

Looking at the information in more detail, S1 is in the countryside to the northwest of Garlsdon, but it is close to the residential area of the town. S2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre. 

There are main roads from Hindon, Bransdon and Cransdon to Garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to S2 by car. By contrast, S1 lies on the main road to Hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from Bransdon and Cransdon. Both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through Garlsdon from Hindon to Cransdon.

The bar chart compares consumer spending on six different items in Germany, Italy, France and Britain. 

It is clear that British people spent significantly more money than people in the other three countries on all six goods. Of the six items, consumers spent the most money on photographic film. 

People in Britain spent just over £170,000 on photographic film, which is the highest figure shown on the chart. By contrast, Germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under £150,000) for each of the six products. 

The figures for spending on toys were the same in both France and Italy, at nearly £160,000. However, while French people spent more than Italians on photographic film and CDs, Italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. The amount spent by French people on tennis racquets, around £145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.

The diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate. The most noticeable difference between houses designed for cool and warm climates is in the shape of the roof. The designs also differ with regard to the windows and the use of insulation. 

We can see that the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. By contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and roof overhangs to shade the windows. Insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep the heat out in warm climates. 

Finally, the cool climate house has one window which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on two sides which are shaded from the sun. By opening the two windows at night, the house designed for warm climates can be ventilated.

The picture illustrates the way in which water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as the water cycle. 

Three main stages are shown on the diagram. Ocean water evaporates, falls as rain, and eventually runs back into the oceans again. 

Beginning at the evaporation stage, we can see that 80% of water vapour in the air comes from the oceans. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate, and water vapour condenses to form clouds. At the second stage, labelled ‘precipitation’ on the diagram, water falls as rain or snow. 

At the third stage in the cycle, rainwater may take various paths. Some of it may fall into lakes or return to the oceans via ‘surface runoff’. Otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth. Salt water intrusion is shown to take place just before groundwater passes into the oceans to complete the cycle.

The first picture shows the layout of an art gallery, and the second shows some proposed changes to the gallery space. 

It is clear that significant changes will be made in terms of the use of floor space in the gallery. There will be a completely new entrance and more space for exhibitions. 

At present, visitors enter the gallery through doors which lead into a lobby. However, the plan is to move the entrance to the Parkinson Court side of the building, and visitors will walk straight into the exhibition area. In place of the lobby and office areas, which are shown on the existing plan, the new gallery plan shows an education area and a small storage area. 

The permanent exhibition space in the redeveloped gallery will be about twice as large as it is now because it will occupy the area that is now used for temporary exhibitions. There will also be a new room for special exhibitions. This room is shown in red on the existing plan and is not currently part of the gallery.

The table compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year. It is clear that the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems. 

The London underground is the oldest system, having opened in 1863. It is also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. The second largest system, in Paris, is only about half the size of the London underground, with 199 kilometres of route. However, it serves more people per year. While only third in terms of size, the Tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year. 

Of the three newer networks, the Washington DC underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the Kyoto and Los Angeles systems. The Los Angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the Kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year.

The pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years. 

Total electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both Australia and France. While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used. 

Coal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country’s electricity. 

Australia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source inFrance, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.

The chart gives information about UK immigration, emigration and net migration between 1999 and 2008.
Both immigration and emigration rates rose over the period shown, but the figures for immigration were significantly higher. Net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007. 

In 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the UK, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. The figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. From 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. Net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004. 

After 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. Emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. As a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.

It is clear from the charts that the figures for developed countries are much higher than those for developing nations. Also, the charts show an overall increase in participation in education and science from 1980 to 1990. 

People in developing nations attended school for an average of around 3 years, with only a slight increase in years of schooling from 1980 to 1990. On the other hand, the figure for industrialised countries rose from nearly 9 years of schooling in 1980 to nearly 11 years in 1990. 

From 1980 to 1990, the number of scientists and technicians in industrialised countries almost doubled to about 70 per 1000 people. Spending on research and development also saw rapid growth in these countries, reaching 350 billion in 1990. By contrast, the number of science workers in developing countries remained below 20 per 1000 people, and research spending fell from about 50 billion to only 25 billion.

The figure illustrates the process used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to forecast the weather.

There are four stages in the process, beginning with the collection of information about the weather. This information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public. 

Looking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.

At the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.

The line graph compares the percentage of people in three countries who used the Internet between 1999 and 2009.

It is clear that the proportion of the population who used the Internet increased in each country over the period shown. Overall, a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the Internet in comparison with Mexicans, and Canada experienced the fastest growth in Internet usage. 

In 1999, the proportion of people using the Internet in the USA was about 20%. The figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. In 2005, Internet usage in both the USA and Canada rose to around 70% of the population, while the figure for Mexico reached just over 25%. 

By 2009, the percentage of Internet users was highest in Canada. Almost 100% of Canadians used the Internet, compared to about 80% of Americans and only 40% of Mexicans.

The map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood between 1868 and 1994. It is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway. 

From 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village. 

The expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.
