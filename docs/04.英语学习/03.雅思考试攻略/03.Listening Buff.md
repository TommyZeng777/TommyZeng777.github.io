1. Excuse me, would you mind if I ask you some questions, we are doing a survey on transport.<!--more-->

2. Yes, that's ok.

3. First of all, can I take your name?

4. Yes, it is Sadie Jones.

5. Thanks very much, and could I  have your date ~~to~~ `of`  birth, just the year will do actually, ~~it's~~ `is` that all right?

   > 将句子中的 "Is that all right?" 写成 "It's that all right?" 会造成语法上的不自然和不准确。这是因为 "It's" 是缩写形式，表示 "It is"，用来指代先前提到的事物或情况。在这个句子中，"It's" 后面跟的是 "that all right?"，这样的用法在英语中不太符合语法规范。
   >
   > 正确的表达应该是 "Is that all right?"，表示询问对方是否同意提供生日信息。这种表达方式更为自然、准确，符合英语语法。

6. Yes, that's fine. It's 1991.

7. So, next your post code please.

8. It's DW307YZ.

9. Great thanks. Is that in wells?

10. No, it's actually in harborne, Wells ~~is~~`isn't` far from there, though.

11. I really like that area, my grandmother ~~live~~ `lived` there when I was a kid.

12. Yes, It is nice.

13. Right, so now I want to ask you some questions about how you ~~traveled~~ `travelled` here today, did you use public transport?

14. Yes, I came by bus. 

15. OK, and that was today, it's the 24th of April, isn't it?

    >  当题目问到日期的时候，使用 "日期th" + "年份" 

16. Isn't it the 25? uh, no, actually you are right.

17. And what was the reason for your trip today? I can see ~~you~~ `you've` got some shopping with you.

18. Yes, I did some shopping, but the main reason I came here was to go to the dentist.

19. That is no much fun, hope it ~~wasn't~~ `was` nothing serious.

20. No it was just a check up, it's fine.

21. Good, did you normally `travel` by bus ~~in~~ `into` the city center?

22. Yes, I stopped driving ~~it~~ `in` aging ~~years~~ ago, because parking was so ~~differcult~~`difficult`  to find, and it costs so much.

23. I see.

24. The bus is much more convenient too, it only takes about 30 minutes.

25. That's good, so where did you start your journey?

26. At the bus stop on claxby street.

27. It ~~the~~ `that` claxby?

28. That's right.

29. And how satisfied ~~wound~~ `with` the service on you , do you have any complaints?

30. Oh, as I ~~say~~ `saied`, it is very ~~convient~~ `convenient` and quick when it is on time. but this morning it ~~is~~ `was` late, only about 10 minutes, but still.

31. Yes, I understand that is `annoying`, and what about the `timetable`, Do you have any ~~comment~~ `comments` about that?

32. Mmm, I ~~suppost~~ `suppose` I mainly use the bus during the day. but anytime I have been `in` town in the evening. for dinner or at the cinema, I `have/I've` noticed you ~~it will waste~~ `have to wait a` long time ~~to wait the~~ `for a` bus. ~~it will be too many.~~`there aren't that many.` 

    > "I've" 的读法为 /aɪv/，类似于英文单词 "I've"。要区分是否有 "have" 这个部分，可以注意以下几点：
    >
    > 1. **语境**：观察句子的语境可以帮助确定是否应该有 "have"。例如，在 "I've finished my homework." 这个句子中，"I've" 是 "I have" 的缩写，因为它与 "finished" 搭配使用时表示已经完成的动作
    >
    > 2. **听音标志**：在口语中，有时候会因为语速快或语音模糊而听不清 "have" 这个部分。在这种情况下，可以通过其他词语或语境来推测应该有 "have"。
    >
    > 3. **重点听音标**：当你遇到 "I've" 这个词时，特别留意是否有清晰的 "v" 音，因为 "I've" 中的 "v" 音和 "have" 的 "v" 音是相同的，这可以帮助你确认是否有 "have"。
    >
    > 总的来说，通过综合语境、听音标志和注意听清 "v" 音可以帮助你区分是否有 "have" 这个部分。

33. OK, thanks, so now, i `I'd` like to ask you `about` ~~the~~ `your` car ~~used~~ `use`.

34. Oh, I have got a car but I don't use it that often, mainly just to go to the supermarket, but that's about it really, my husband ~~use~~ `uses` it at `the` weekends to go to the golf ~~park~~ `club`.

35. And what about the ~~bycyle~~ `bicycle`?

36. I don't actually have ~~that in a~~ `one at the` moment.

37. what about city ~~bike~~ `bikes` you can rent, do you ~~have~~ `ever` use ~~though~~ `those`?

38. No ~~i~~ `I'm` not `keen` ~~can~~ on ~~cyleing~~ `cycling` ~~their~~ `there` because ~~it~~ `of` all the ~~pallution~~`pollution`. ~~i will can to bring~~ `but I would like to get` a bike, ~~because it better~~ `it would be good to use it to get` to work.

39. So Why haven't you ~~get~~ `got` one now?

40. Will, I live in a flat on the second ~~follow~~ `floor`, and it doesn't have any storage, so ~~we~~ `we'd/we would` have to ~~line~~ `leave it`  in ~~a hole~~ ` the hall` outside the flat.

    > 在这个句子中，"we'd" 的读音通常为 /wiːd/，即 "we" 的音标 /wiː/ 和 "would" 的音标 /d/ 连在一起。因此，"we'd" 读起来类似于 "weed"，但是没有 "w" 的音。

 







##  剑雅18 T1S2

1. Good evening everyone.

2. Let me star by welcoming you `all` to this talk and thanking you for taking the time to consider joining ACE ~~volunture~~ `voluntary` organization.

3. ACE ~~office~~ `offer` support to people and services in the local area, and ~~when~~ `we're` now looking for more ~~volunter~~ `volunteers` to help us to do this.

   > 这句话比较难，重点关注。

4. By the way, I hope ~~you will~~ `you're all` ~~conferteable~~ `comfortable` - we have ~~bought~~ `brought in` extra ~~seat~~ `seats so that no one has to stand`, but ~~this~~ `it` ~~doen't~~ `doesn't` mean that the people `at the` back of the room may  ~~feel squete~~` be a bit squashed`.

   > - [ ] squashed: 在这里是作为形容词，表示被压扁或者挤压的状态。
   >
   > 例句：I feel so squashed in this crowded bus.(我在这辆拥挤的公交车上感到很不舒服。)

5. ~~We lonely~~ `We'll only/we will only` be here for about half a hour, so ~~hopefuly~~ `hopefully`, that's ok.

   > 听到 "We'll only" 被误听成 "We lonely" 的情况可能是因为发音相似或者语速较快导致的听觉误解。要区分这两种说法，可以注意以下几点：
   >
   > 1. **重点词的强调**: "We'll only be here" 中的重点词是 "only"，表示只会在这里待一小段时间。如果是 "We lonely be here"，这个句子的意思就变得不合逻辑了，因为 "lonely" 表示孤独而不是时间短暂。
   > 2. **语境**: 确定整个句子的语境有助于理解。如果谈话内容是关于待在某处的时间，那么更有可能是 "We'll only be here"。
   > 3. **听力训练**: 练习听力可以帮助提高对于口语连读的理解和区分能力。可以通过听音频、对话或者参加语言课程来提升这方面的技能。
   >
   > 总体来说，通过注意重点词、语境和加强听力训练，可以更准确地区分口语连读中类似的发音。

6. One of the first question we're often ~~ask~~ `asked` is how old you need to be ~~a~~ `to` volunteer.

7. Will, you can be as young as 16 or you can be ~~16~~ `60` or over, ~~it's~~ `it` all ~~depend~~ ` depends on` what `type of` voluntary work you want to do.

8. Other ~~consideration~~ `considerations`, such as ~~relabelita~~ `reliability`, are ~~crutie~~ `crucial` in voluntary work and age isn't relate to ~~this~~ `these`, in our ~~expersince~~ `experience`.

   > - [ ] reliability:可靠性
   >
   > 为什么这里用these而不是this?
   >
   > 因为这里的these是指代前面的such as reliability以及type of voluntary等方面的，因此是复数形式，使用these表示这些。

9. ~~And other~~ `Another` question we get ~~up~~ `asked` ~~related~~ `relates` to training.

10. Well, ~~thats~~ `there's` ~~plante at~~ `plenty of` that and ~~is~~ `it's` all face-to-face.

    > - [ ] plenty: a large amount; as much or as many as you need

11. What's more, training doesn't end when you start working for us, it take place before ~~ju~~ `during` and after ~~period~~ `periods`  of work.

    > - [ ] it take place意思是某件事情发生或举行。这个短语通常用来描述事件、活动或者情况的发生或进行
    >
    > during在英式英语的发音中音标为英/ˈdjʊərɪŋ/，和美音区别很大

12. Often ~~it's one~~ `it's run` by other ~~experience  volunteer~~ `experienced volunteers` as managers tend to prefer to `get on` ~~another~~ `with other` things.

    > 通常情况下，培训是由其他有经验的志愿者进行的，因为管理人员往往有其他事情要做。

13. Now I ~~will~~ `would` ask you to consider a couple `of` important ~~issue~~ `issues` before you decide to apply ~~to~~ `for` voluntary work.

14. We don't worry about why you want to be a volunteer, people have many different reasons ~~there~~ `that` range from getting work experience to just doing something ~~they away~~ `they've always` wanted to do.

    > they've always wanted to do为现在完成时
    >
    > 使用现在完成时可以强调一个动作或状态从过去一直延续到现在，并且可能会继续下去。在这句话中，"they have always wanted to do"表达的是一个过去一直延续到现在的愿望或动作，强调了这个愿望或动作的持续性和连续性。

15. But it's ~~curital~~ `critical` that you have enough hours in ~~a~~ `the` day for whatever role we agree is ~~suitful to~~ `suitable for` you. if being a volunteer ~~to~~ ~~become~~     `becomes` stressful ~~that is better not to be~~  `then it's best not to do`it at all.

    > role在这里是名词，指的是某个具体的职责或者角色
    >
    > we agree在这里是我们认为的意思

16. You may think that your income is important but we don't ~~asked~~`ask` about that.

17. It's up to you to decide if you can work without ~~any~~ `earning` money.

18. What we value is ~~deadecation~~`dedication`.

19. Some of out most ~~los~~~loyal volunteer ~~aren't~~`earn` very little themselves but still give ~~they~~`their` full energy to work ~~that their~~`they` do with us.

20. Ok, so let's take a look at some of the work ~~area~~`areas that` we need volunteers for and the sort of ~~thing~~`things that` would help you ~~and~~`in` those.

    > this这个	these这些
    >
    > that那个	those那些
    >
    > 做好区分

21. You may wish simply to help us raise money.

    > raise money：筹集资金

    >
    > - [ ] fundraising：筹款
    > - [ ] imaginative：想象力的
    >
    > >  "we'd" 是 "we had" 或 "we would" 的缩写形式，具体取决于上下文。这种缩写常见于口语或非正式的书面语境中。下面是两种可能的全称：
    > >
    > >  1. "We had" 的全称是 "we had"，表示过去发生的动作或情况。
    > >  - 例如：We'd already finished dinner when you arrived.（我们吃完晚饭了，当你到达时。）
    > >  2. "We would" 的全称是 "we would"，表示条件、假设或意愿。
    > >  - 例如：We'd go hiking if the weather were better.（如果天气好一点，我们会去远足的。）

## 剑雅18 T1S3

心得：这篇的难度较大，即使逐句听写后听起来做题仍然难度较大，最大的问题是录音中的部分词汇(虽然看了都会)但听音无法识别，造成文章意思理解困难。且题目的理解难度也不小，需要结合听音内容做大量综合性思考，很容易选错。

> Tips: 对话dialogue题型中一定要分辨角色信息，尤其是角色名字并不大众，如这道题女的叫Chantal，男的叫Hugo，不清楚名字指的是录音中的哪个角色一些题目没法做，比如问到其中一个人的观点的时候。

1. Hi Chantal, what ~~do~~`did` you think of the talk, then？

   > then在这里是口语化用法，用来表示“那么，你怎么看？；那你觉得呢？”
   >
   > 提出建议或提议：
   >
   > - "Why don't we go for a walk in the park, then?"
   > - "How about we meet for coffee tomorrow, then?"

2. Hi Hugo, I ~~saw~~`thought` it was good ~~one side~~`once I'd` moved the seats.

3. Oh, ~~would~~`were` the people beside you chatting or something?

   > would开头显然不符合这句话语境的表达方式，would表达的更多是请求、猜测或假设的意思。
   >
   > chat的ing形式需要双写`t`

4. It wasn't that. I went early so ~~of~~`that` ~~I~~`I'd` get ~~the~~`a` seat ~~that~~`and` ~~no~~`not` have to stand. but then ~~there~~`this` ~~is~~ ~~a~~ guy ~~arriving~~`sat right in` front of me and he was so tall!

   > I'd get a seat在情境中指的是过去某个时间点的目的和计划，并非涉及动作，所以采用常规事态，I'd在这里是I would的简写，不是I had
   >
   > sat是sit的过去式

5. It's hard to see through ~~people~~`people's` heads, isn't it?

6. Yes, ~~imposible~~`impossible`, Anyway, to answer your question. I ~~saw~~`thought` it was very interesting. espeically what the speaker say about the job market.

   > I thought 我认为，很容易听成I saw

7. Me too, I mean we know ~~we were~~`we're` going into a really ~~compatative~~`competitive` ~~feel~~`field` so it's obvious that we may struggle to get work.

8. That's right, and we know we ~~can~~`can't` all have that dream job.

9. Yeah, but it looks like there is a ~~hall~~`whole` range of ~~ever~~`areas` of work that we ~~have~~`hadn't` even ~~photo~~`thought of`--- like fashion ~~jounlist~~`fashion journalism`,`for instance.`

   > - [ ] journalism：新闻工作、新闻业

10. Yeah, I ~~was~~`wan't` ~~expected~~`expecting` so many ~~carrer~~`career` ~~option~~`options`.

11. Mmm, overall she ~~have~~ `had` quite a strong message, didn't she?.

12. She did, She ~~ca~~`kept` ~~same~~`saying` ~~thing~~`things` like : 'I know you will ~~thing~~think this, but...' , and then ~~she~~`she'd` tell `us` ~~what~~`how` ~~will~~`it` ~~the~~ really is.

13. Perhaps she ~~think~~`thinks` students ~~will~~`are` a bit ~~nowa in mind~~`narrow-minded` ~~in~~`about the` industry.

14. It was ~~be~~`a bit` ~~hash~~`harsh`, though, we know ~~is~~`it's a` ~~though~~`tough` industry.

15. Yeah, ~~I am~~`and` ~~very fast she~~`we're only first years` ~~off the room~~`after all`, ~~we~~`we've` got a lot ~~of~~`to` learn.

16. Exactly, Do you think our ~~second school~~`secondary-school education` should have ~~be~~`been` more ~~career focus~~`career-focused`?

    > - [ ] secondary-school education：中学教育阶段

17. Well, we ~~have~~`had` ~~num~~`numerous` ~~talk~~`talks` in careers which ~~is~~`was` good, but none of them ~~will~~`were` very inspiring, ~~their~~`they` could `have` ~~ask~~`asked` more people like ~~today~~`today's` speaker to talk to us.

    > they是主格，their是所有格=n名词's

18. I ~~have~~ agree, We ~~will~~`were` ~~talk~~`told` about lots of different careers. Just `when` we want needed to be, but not by the ~~expect~~`expects` who really know stuff.

    > 我们被告知了很多不同的职业，正是我们需要的时候，但并不是由真正了解这些行业的专家来告诉们。

19. So, did today talk ~~inflance~~`influence` your ~~sort~~`thoughts` on what career ~~you~~`you'd` like to take `up` in the future.

20. Will, I ~~promise~~`~promised` myself that ~~I~~`I'd` go through this course and ~~keeping~~`keep an` open mind ~~until~~`~till` the end.

21. But, I think it is better to pick ~~in~~ `an` area of `the` industry now and `then` aim to get better and better it.

    > pick an area：选择一个领域
    >
    > aim to：to try or plan to achieve something
    >
    > better and better it：越来越好

22. Well, I think ~~we~~`we'll` just have ~~a~~`to` ~~different~~`differ` ~~mtsh~~`on that issue`.

    > we'll是we will的简写，这里使用we will表达了一种决心或决定，暗示了对某个观点或看法的坚持。通过使用 "we will"，强调了对立意见的存在，表达了双方在这个问题上的不同看法。

23. ~~unthink~~`One thing's for` certain ~~no~~`though`. ~~for~~`From` what she ~~saied~~`said`, ~~were~~`we'll` be ~~unpaied~~`unpaid` ~~system~~`assistants` in `the` industry for quite a long time.

24. Mmm.

25. ~~Unprepretait~~`I'm prepared` for that, ~~not you~~`aren't you`?

26. Actually, I'm not going to accept that view.

    > accept that view：接受那种观点

27. Really? But she ~~know~~`knows` ~~is~~`it's` the case, and everyone else ~~said~~`says` the same.

    > - [ ] It's the case：这是事实

28. That doesn't ~~meaning~~`mean it` has to be ~~treat~~`true` for me.

29. OK, well, I hope ~~you~~`you're` right.

30. I thought ~~this~~`the` ~~speaker~~`speaker's` ~~caut~~`account of` her first job was ~~fastning~~`fascinating`

    > account 在这里并不是账户的意思，而是描述、叙述某个事物，来源于财务或商业上记录和描述交易

33. Mmm, And then ~~she~~`he` was so mean, telling her she was more ~~interesting~~`interested` in her `own` ~~parents~~`appearance` than ~~him~~`his`.

34. But, She did realise he was right about that, which really ~~make~~`made` me think, I am always ~~consider~~`considering` my own clothes but now I can see `you` ~~usually~~`should` be ~~focus~~`focusing` ~~in~~ on your ~~cliates~~`client`.

38. Yeah, well, she ~~recommeded~~`recommended` we all do it ~~on~~`at` some point. I guess as a ~~design~~`designer`, ~~you~~`you'd` get to find out some useful information, like how big or small the ~~effort~~`average` ~~shortpretg~~`shopper is`.

39. I think ~~this is~~`that's` the `an` issue for ~~mucfract~~`manufacturers,` not designers. However, it would be useful to know `if` there is a gap in the market you know, ~~and~~`an` item that no ~~one~~`one's` ~~stucking~~`stocking` but ~~the~~`that` consumers ~~is~~`are` looking for.

    > - [ ] manufacturer：制造商
