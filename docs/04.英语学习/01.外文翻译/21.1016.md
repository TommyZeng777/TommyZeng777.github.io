Microplastics are everywhere, even in the Arctic snow

塑料微粒无处不在，即使是北极的雪里。

**Microplastics** are some of the Earth's tiniest and most **insidious** enemies. These tiny bits of plastic are found in **countless** consumer products including **cosmetics**, **tires**, **cigarettes** and **toothpaste**, and when they **collect** in **bodies of water** and other natural areas, they can **pose** serious environmental **hazards** and health risks.<!-- more -->

> 塑料微粒，是地球最微小的和最隐秘的敌人。这些微小的塑料在数不清的消费者产品中被发现，包括化妆品、轮胎、香烟和牙膏，当他们聚集在水体和自然区域时，会造成严重的环境危害和健康风险。
>
> Microplastic分析：组合词，micro指的是微小的，plastic塑料
>
> insidious：阴险的、狡猾的、隐秘的
>
> countless：数不清的、无数的
>
> cosmetic：化妆品
>
> tire：轮胎
>
> cigarette：香烟

> toothpaste：牙膏
>
> collect：这里是**“汇集、聚集”**的意思
>
> bodies of water：水体，指的是山川湖泊河流江河海洋地下水等等的总称
>
> pose：造成
>
> hazard：危害、危险

In fact, a new study reveals that microplastics have even polluted **Alpine** snow and **Arctic** ice. How did the microplastics get there? The study, **published** this week in the **journal** Science Advances, **posits** that the tiny particles become **airborne** and, when **swept up** into the Earth's atmosphere, can be transported **virtually** around the globe.

> 事实上，鲸的研究揭示了微型塑料甚至已经污染了高山上的雪和北极的冰。微型塑料是怎么样到达那里的？一个发表在这周发科学进展杂志上的一项研究，假设了这一些微小的例子会在空气中传播，当被卷入到地球的大气层时，几乎可以在世界范围内运输。

"The large concentrations of MPs and microfibers in snow highlight the importance of the atmosphere as a source of airborne MPs and microfibers, " the study reads. "Through this pathway, MPs likely find their way into soil and aquatic environments and therefore also into food chains."

In other words, if microplastics are found in pristine Arctic ice, they're probably being breathed in, lived in and eaten by animals in other ecosystems.

If microplastics are being swirled around the atmosphere, the study says, we're breathing them in, as well. And that could have serious health consequences.

"The high MP concentrations detected in snow samples from continental Europe to the Arctic indicate significant air pollution and stress the urgent need for research on human and animal health effects focusing on airborne MPs, " the study says.
