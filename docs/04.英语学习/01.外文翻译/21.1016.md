Microplastics are everywhere, even in the Arctic snow

塑料微粒无处不在，即使是北极的雪里。

**Microplastics** are some of the Earth's tiniest and most **insidious** enemies. These tiny bits of plastic are found in **countless** consumer products including **cosmetics**, **tires**, **cigarettes** and **toothpaste**, and when they **collect** in **bodies of water** and other natural areas, they can **pose** serious environmental **hazards** and health risks.<!-- more -->

> 塑料微粒，是地球最微小的和最隐秘的敌人。这些微小的塑料在数不清的消费者产品中被发现，包括化妆品、轮胎、香烟和牙膏，当他们聚集在水体和自然区域时，会造成严重的环境危害和健康风险。
>
> Microplastic分析：组合词，micro指的是微小的，plastic塑料

"The large concentrations of **MPs** and microfibers in snow highlight the importance of the atmosphere as a **source of airborne** MPs and microfibers, " the study reads. "Through this pathway, MPs **likely find their way into** soil and **aquatic** environments and **therefore** also into food chains."

**In other words**, if microplastics are found in **pristine** Arctic ice, they're probably being breathed in, lived in and eaten by animals in other ecosystems.
