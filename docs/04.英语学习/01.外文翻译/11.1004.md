You’re on a beach. White sand surrounds you. A cool **breeze** gently passes over from the **turquoise** waters just beyond your feet. You **sip** your **piña colada**, **moving aside** the tiny umbrella.<!-- more -->

> 你在一个沙滩上。白色的沙子环绕着你。凉爽的微风就在你的脚边，温和地吹过碧绿的海水。你小口喝着凤梨可乐达（一种鸡尾酒），把小伞诺到了一边。
>
> breeze：微风
>
> turquoise：绿松石色
>
> sip：小口喝
>
> piña colada：[凤梨可乐达鸡尾酒](https://www.lezuocai.com/recipe/1199228/)
>
> moving aside：移动到一边

Or, you’re on a beach. Every **square inch** is covered with people. Beyond the beach is a **rock-laden** sea with **currents** so strong it’s impossible to safely swim.

> 或者你在一个沙滩上，每平方英寸都挤满了人。在沙滩之外是一片充满岩石的海，海浪如此强劲，无法安全游泳。
>
> square inch：平方英寸
>
> rock-laden：充满岩石；
>
> laden：满载的意思，laden with：满载而归
>
> current：n.海浪  adj.最近的，近期

I’m sure you can imagine the disappointment, after planning a trip for months with the **expectation** of the first beach, you get the second. There is another way: Book only the first few days.

> 我保证，你可以想象到那份失望，在经过数月的旅游计划，带着对第一个沙滩的期待，你却得到的是第二个。但这里还有一种别的方法：只订开始的几天的行程。
>
> expectation：期望

Surprisingly, this method rarely leads to issues, though it does occasionally require **flexibility**. Perhaps the hostel is booked, the best flight is too expensive or there isn’t space on the ferry. But if you don’t **have your heart set on** a specific hotel or an **exact** flight, you’ll be able to find options that are pretty close to your initial choices.

> 令人惊讶的是，这种方法很少会导致问题，尽管它偶尔需要灵活性。可能酒店都被订了，最好的那一班航空特别贵，又或者是渡船没有空间了。但是如果你不将你的心放在特定的就对或准确的航班上，你将能够会找到与你最初的设想十分接近的选项。
>
> flexibility：灵活性
>
> have your heart set on：将你的心放在…什么上
>
> exact：准确的

On a two-week trip, book your first few days, and perhaps your last night. **After those first days** you’ll **have a much better idea** of your location, what you want out of that location and maybe even find **a better area or place to stay**. For example, after four days at a **horrifying resort**, you may find the beach you really want is on the other side of the island.

> 在一个两个星期的旅行中，订你头几天所需的内容，也许还有最后一晚。在最初的几天之后，你将更好地了解你的位置，在那个目的地有什么你想要的，或者可能找到一个更棒的区域或住宿地点。例如，在四天令人惊悚的度假胜地之后，也许你可以在岛的另外一边找到你真正想要的沙滩。
>
> After those first days：在最初的几天过去后
>
> have a much better idea：更好地了解你的位置
>
> a better area or place to stay：更好的地方或住宿地点
>
> horrifying resort：惊悚的度假胜地

Relaxation and piña coladas await.

> 放松，凤梨可乐达在等着你。

::: note
说的对呀，旅行，就不给自己太大的压力了，不盲目追随潮流。跟随自己的内心，享受大自然，享受每一次偶然间的美
