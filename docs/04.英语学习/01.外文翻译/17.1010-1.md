Where did ice cream come from?<!-- more -->
Historians believe the ancient Chinese were the first to develop a cool, creamy treat that resembles the ice cream we enjoy today. In the 1500's, ice cream started to spread through Europe, though at first only rich aristocrats could afford it.
When did the US create National Ice Cream Day?
Thanks to President Ronald Reagan, National Ice Cream Day is a legit holiday.
In 1984, he signed a proclamation that declared July to be National Ice Cream Month. The third Sunday of that month became officially known as National Ice Cream Day.
How much ice cream do Americans consume?
Today, the average American consumes more than 20 pounds of ice cream each year, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.
If you think that's a lot of ice cream, multiply it by 329 million Americans.
What's the most popular flavor of ice cream in the US?
From Neapolitan to chocolate chip cookie dough, there's no shortage of ice cream flavors.
Ice cream can even be made without the help of cows. Biotech company Perfect Day debuted a lab-grown dairy ice cream that uses genetic engineering to recreate the proteins usually found in cow's milk.
Still, the top flavor in the US? Plain old vanilla, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.
