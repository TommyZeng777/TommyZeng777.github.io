## Hunt for proof of Epstein's crimes turns to 'paedophile island' after FBI raid
在FBI突击调查后，寻找爱泼斯坦罪行的证据转向了“恋童癖岛”
>Aug.27 · 2019

Despite the disgraced financier's suicide on the weekend, Attorney General William Barr has vowed to continue the federal sex-trafficking case against him and "any co-conspirators".
Little St James Island has gained a variety of sinister nicknames over the years, including 'Paedophile Island' and 'Orgy Island.'
He purchased the island in 1998 for $7.95 million, and his 75-acre property there is now ringed with towering 40ft palm trees, dotted with large parrot structures, and protected by security guards.
The billionaire built roads, villas, and a mysterious white square edifice that looked like a temple with a golden dome.
One former employee said Epstein once had a large ferry in which he transported up to 200 workers from the larger island of St Thomas to his island every day for construction work.
Another former worker told Bloomberg he saw women sunbathing naked and there was a "zen-like" atmosphere.
There was also a steel safe in the main house, with such a high level of security it was suggested the lock box "contained more than just money."
Epstein's stone mansion on the island has cream walls and a bright turquoise roof. Nearby is a maids' quarters.
One alleged Epstein victim has claimed to have seen former US President Bill Clinton on the island.
A Clinton spokesman has issued a statement saying he never visited there.
