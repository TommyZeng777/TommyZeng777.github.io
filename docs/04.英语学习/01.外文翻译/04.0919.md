**The queen, the media and changing times**
**女王，媒体和变化中的时代**

One of the biggest challenges of covering Elizabeth's life and reign has long involved balancing admiration for her sense of public duty with the changing attitudes toward the monarchy.<!-- more -->

CNN correspondent Scott McLean interviewed a young woman standing outside Windsor Castle.


"I think it is pretty sad, " the woman said. "You wouldn't want that to happen to your own family member. But I'm not like the biggest fan of the queen or the monarchy in general. So, I'm not that upset or overwhelmed by it." The woman cited "British colonial history" and the allegations of sexual misconduct by Prince Andrew as her reasons.
>“我认为这是件相当悲伤的事”,这位女士说道，“大家都不希望这些发生在自己的家庭成员身上。但我并不像通常见到的那些女王或者君主制的超级粉丝那样。所以我并没有因此而心烦意乱或不知所措。” 这位女士引用了“英国的殖民历史”和安德鲁王子对性行为不端的指控作为了她的理由。
>
>cite v.提及、引用
>
>allegation n.指控


The interview quickly lost in a tidal wave of pundit praise and interviewees saying how profoundly sad they were at the passing of someone they came to think of as an island of tradition and stability in an era of disruption and conflict. But that voice needed to be part of the coverage.


Katty Kay, a BBC Studios correspondent, explained why she thought her channel and others around the world went to rolling coverage of Elizabeth's death. "She was the constant, reassuring presence in an ever-changing world."


Saying her words were not meant to "canonize" the queen, Kay added, "There were mistakes that were made. The death of Diana stands out as the biggest one." But, Kay concluded, "She won the trust of her subjects and she kept the trust of her subjects for 70 years...that is a remarkable feat."
