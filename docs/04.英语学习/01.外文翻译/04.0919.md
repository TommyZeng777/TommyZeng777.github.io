## Sep.19 · 2022 The queen, the media and changing times
>女王，媒体和变化中的时代

One of the biggest challenges of covering Elizabeth's life and reign has long involved balancing admiration for her sense of public duty with the changing attitudes toward the monarchy.<!-- more -->
>长久以来，报道伊丽莎白的生活和统治的最大的挑战就在于长期涉及到需要平衡对她的公共责任感的钦佩和对君主制度态度的变化。
>
>covering Elizabeth：报道伊丽莎白
>
>long involved：长期涉及
>
>admiration：钦佩
>
>monarchy：君主制度
>
>reign：统治


Of course, in the ==wake of the death== of such a figure, the impetus is all the more compelling to only bring praise.
>当然，在这样一个人物去世的唤醒仪式上，
>赞扬的动力只会更加强烈。
>
>wake of the death：貌似是基督教中死后的唤醒仪式的意思，女王是信基督的
>
>impetus：动力
>
>all the more：更加
>
>compelling：非常强烈的，引人入胜的，不可抗拒的
>
>praise：赞扬


But media generally found ways to sing her praises while not ignoring criticism of her family.
>但是媒体通常会寻找方法去歌颂她，同时又不会忽略对她家庭的批判。

CNN correspondent Scott McLean interviewed a young woman standing outside Windsor Castle.


"I think it is pretty sad, " the woman said. "You wouldn't want that to happen to your own family member. But I'm not like the biggest fan of the queen or the monarchy in general. So, I'm not that upset or overwhelmed by it." The woman cited "British colonial history" and the allegations of sexual misconduct by Prince Andrew as her reasons.
>“我认为这是件相当悲伤的事”,这位女士说道，“大家都不希望这些发生在自己的家庭成员身上。但我并不像通常见到的那些女王或者君主制的超级粉丝那样。所以我并没有因此而心烦意乱或不知所措。” 这位女士引用了“英国的殖民历史”和安德鲁王子对性行为不端的指控作为了她的理由。
>
>cite v.提及、引用
>
>allegation n.指控


The interview quickly lost in a tidal wave of pundit praise and interviewees saying how profoundly sad they were at the passing of someone they came to think of as an island of tradition and stability in an era of disruption and conflict. But that voice needed to be part of the coverage.
>这篇采访快速的在权威人士们如同潮汐波浪般的赞美中消失了，受访者表示，他们对一个让他们在混乱和冲突的时代具有传统和稳定的国家环境的君主的逝世感到非常难过。
>
>in an era of disruption and conflict  在一个混乱和冲突的年代

Katty Kay, a BBC Studios correspondent, explained why she thought her channel and others around the world went to rolling coverage of Elizabeth's death. "She was the constant, reassuring presence in an ever-changing world."
>kk，一个bbc工作室的通讯员，解释了为何她觉得她全球的频道和其他媒体都在循环滚动女王去世的消息。
>“在这个不断变化的世界里，她是永恒的和令人安心的存在”

Saying her words were not meant to "canonize" the queen, Kay added, "There were mistakes that were made. The death of Diana stands out as the biggest one." But, Kay concluded, "She won the trust of her subjects and she kept the trust of her subjects for 70 years...that is a remarkable feat."
>她说的话并不是在褒扬女王，K补充道：“她们导致了很多的错误。戴安娜的死是其中最大的一个错误。” 但是，K同时也说到，“她赢得了她的臣民们的信任，并保持这份信任达70多年。这是一个了不起的壮举。”
>
>subjects：臣民（和平时意思区别特别大）
>
>canonize：褒扬
>
>stand out：脱颖而出（暂时没有想到更好的词，大概意思就是很突出，超出一众别的事情）
