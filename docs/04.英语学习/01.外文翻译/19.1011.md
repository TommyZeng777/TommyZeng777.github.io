Don't be fooled by health food imposters — here's what to avoid

不要被健康食品的骗局愚弄了——在此讲讲什么是可以避开的坑

"Low fat", "low sugar", "all natural" and other marketing terms that give foods a "health halo" can often disguise unhealthy ingredients, additives and ultra-processing methods that don't do us any good.
What's the truth about these so-called healthy foods and drinks that you really could do without?
Fruit juice
Fruit juice can be healthy but only up to a point: more than the recommended 150ml/day and the sugar content outweighs the nutritional benefits. Fruit juice counts as a "free" sugar, which most of us need to cut back on.
"The issue with fruit juice is that people don't just stick to 150ml, " says Dr Kathy Redfern, lecturer in human nutrition at Plymouth University. "Orange juice, for example, is a good source of vitamin C, but you're missing out on the fibre and other micronutrients in the whole fruit."
Salads
Dousing your salad with dressing can undo the benefits, according to Diabetes UK, which has analysed popular bottled dressings. Many are sweetened with sugar, molasses or fruit concentrates and loaded with salt and saturated fat.
Low fat yogurt
Low or zero fat yogurts, and those promoted as "no added sugar", aren't the healthiest choice, according to Dr Redfern.
Flavoured yogurts that are low or zero fat often contain fruit juice concentrates and / or purees — "free sugars" — along with other additives to make them palatable. And no-added sugar yogurts contain artificial sweeteners. "And I think the jury's still out on those, " Dr Redfern says.
