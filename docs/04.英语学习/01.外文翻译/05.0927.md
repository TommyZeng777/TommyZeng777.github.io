## ‘Women don’t need to bleed’: why many more of us are giving up on periods

女性不需要来月经，为什么越来越多的女性开始放弃来月经

>Sep.05 · 2019 文章内容大家理性看待，这篇文章2019年的了

With recent confirmation that periods have no health benefit, an increasing number of women are using contraception to stop them altogether.
>近期的研究证实，月经对身体健康并没有益处，越来越多的女性开始使用避孕手段去彻底阻止月经的到来
>
>contraception 避孕
>
>altogether 完全的


Menstruation is the process by which the body sheds the lining of the uterus and unfertilised egg. 
>月经是身体子宫内膜和未受精卵子脱落的过程
>
>shed v.脱落
>
>menstruation 月经
>
>uterus 子宫
>
>unfertilised egg 未受精的卵子


Not having periods does not create a “backlog”, nor are they necessary to “cleanse the body”. Menstruation can, however, exacerbate incapacitating physical or mental health problems including endometriosis and depression.
>不来月经并不会产生积压，也不需要用它们来清理身体。相反月经可能会加剧行动不便或产生心理健康问题，包括产生子宫膜异位症和抑郁症等问题。
>
>backlog n.工作积压



So, if women do not want a period, is there a medical reason that they should? Many may be surprised to learn that the short answer is: no.
>所以，如果女性不想要来月经，她们应该要有医学上的理由不？很多人可能会对这个这个简短的答案感到惊讶：不用。

Dr Anne Connolly, the clinical lead for Women’s Health for the Royal College of GPs, says there is no health benefit to them: “Ninety-nine per cent of women don’t need to bleed.”
>英国皇家大学全科医生女性健康方向的临床带头人AC博士，说到来月经并没有对健康有好处：“99%的女性没有必要来月经。”
>
>clinical：adj.临床的
>
>Royal：皇室的
>
>GPs: General practitioner 全科医生


The option not to have periods is rooted in hormonal contraceptives, which prevent pregnancy, sometimes with other effects — including lightening bleeding or stopping it altogether. 
>女性能选择不来月经的根源在于激素类避孕药(短效避孕药)。可以防止怀孕，并且有时可以带来其他效果——包括减少月经出血量或者完全停止来月经
>
>contraceptive n.避孕药物(平时是做形容词的,在这里比较特殊)
>
>prevent: v.防止
>
>pregnancy: 怀孕
>
>hormonal: 荷尔蒙/激素
>A is rooted in B: A的根源在于B


Many new forms of contraception — including the contraceptive implant and injection — are designed to be taken continuously, meaning many users can safely go months or years without any bleeding.
>很多新型避孕药 -- 包括植入皮肤和注射形式的,是针对连续使用设计的, 这意味着许多的使用者可以安全的在长时间内稳定不来月经
>
>form v.(使)出现 n.类型
>
>implant n.植入物
>
>injection n.注射物



The benefits can be myriad, from saving money to mitigating health problems.
>使用避孕手段的好处众多, 包括节省钱和缓解健康问题
>
>mitigating v.减轻, 缓解

But some women may prefer not to use hormonal contraceptives. 
Some experts agree that more research is needed into the long-term effects of taking hormonal contraception. However, they say there should be greater awareness of the benefits of contraceptives beyond preventing pregnancy.
>但是部分女性也可能不会倾向于使用激素类避孕药. 一些专家也同意这个观点, 使用激素类避孕药所带来的长期影响还需要更多的研究. 但是他们也说到, 人们应该更清醒的意识到激素类避孕药带来的好好处不止是阻止怀孕, 还可以为女性带来很多好处.

Sophie, 24, from Glasgow, no longer bleeds thanks to the contraceptive implant, and says: “Just because something is natural, I don’t think it in any way means we should have to go through it. Different things suit different people, and that’s fantastic.”
>来自Glasgow的24岁女性Sophie, 得益于皮下埋植避孕药已经不来月经了. 她说到:"我完全不觉得, 仅仅是因为来月经是天生的, 我们就得经受它(来月经的痛苦). 不同的方式适合不同的人, 避孕药真的是太好了."
>
>not... in any way: 表示完全不.... (类似完全不觉得啥的)
