## Can you really count your way to good health? ---- 8 hours of sleep
>你真的能统计你的健康之路嘛

>8小时睡眠



Sleep has become a national obsession, with a slew of apps, trackers and gurus telling us we need eight hours a night. But don't fret if you're getting — and needing — more or less than that.
>伴随着大量的睡眠追踪软件和大师告诉我们每天晚上都需要有了8个小时的睡眠，睡觉开始成为全民痴迷的事。但是如果你需要更长时间或更短时间的睡眠时，不要因此而烦恼。<!-- more -->

"We have no idea where that figure came from, " says Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and author of How To Sleep Well. "There isn't a shred of proof we need it." 
>尼尔斯坦利，一位睡眠方面的专家，《如何睡好觉》的作者说到：“我们也不知道这个数字是哪里来的，并没有零碎的证据证明我们需要这么做。”

>v. 计算、谋取。。。

One possible explanation is the 8-hour day movement, which started in Australia, Britain and America in 1850, and was based around the idea that the working man needed 8 hours of work, 8 hours of leisure and 8 hours of sleep within a 24-hour period.
>一个可能的解释是每天8小时运动，一项在1850年起源于澳大利亚，英国和美国的工人运动，基于一位劳动者每天需要8小时劳动，8小时休息以及8小时的睡眠。


"It's not a bad figure to aim for, but sleep is like height, " says Stanley. "It's genetically determined and we're all different. So sleep trackers are quite pointless because they're measuring something that's as individual as a fingerprint."
>斯坦利说到：“对于睡眠来说，这不是一个坏的数字，但睡眠其实和体重类似，是由遗传上决定的且每个人都是不同的。所以睡眠监测是相当没有意义的，因为它测量的一些东西是如同每个人的指纹一样独一无二的。” 
>
>to aim for：作形式主语，aim目标，这里特指前面提到的8小时的睡眠需求
>
>genetically：基因上
>
>individual：个人


Last month, neurologist and sleep disorder specialist Dr Guy Leschziner warned sleep-tracking apps were making people so anxious about getting enough sleep they were developing insomnia.
>上个月，神经科和睡眠障碍专家Guy Leschziner博士警告到：睡眠检测软件可能会导致人们产生对于获取到充足睡眠的焦虑感，这会加剧失眠。
>
>neurologist: 神经科医生

>
>specialist：专家
>
>insomnia：失眠

It's simple to work out how many hours you need, says Stanley. "What matters is how you feel at 11am. If you feel OK, then you're getting enough sleep. So ignore the 8-hour-rule. It doesn't matter how long it takes you to fall asleep, how many times you wake in the night, or how you feel when you wake up."

> 计算出你需要睡多少个小时很简单，斯坦利说到：“重要的是当你在上午11点时，你感觉如何？如果你感觉很好，这就代表你得到了充足的睡眠。所以忽略掉8小时的规则吧。无论你花了多长时间入睡，晚上醒多少次或者是你起床时的感受，都无关紧要。”

8 hours of sleep
Sleep has become a national obsession, with a slew of apps, trackers and gurus telling us we need eight hours a night. But don't fret if you're getting — and needing — more or less than that.

"We have no idea where that figure came from, " says Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and author of How To Sleep Well. "There isn't a shred of proof we need it."
