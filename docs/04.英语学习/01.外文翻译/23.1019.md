The 40-year evolution from :-) to 😂

At 11:44 a.m. on September 19, 1982, Scott Fahlman made Internet history by stitching together a colon, a hyphen and a close parenthesis (":-)").<!-- more -->

With that smiley face, Fahlman attempted to solve a familiar problem to today's internet users: conveying sarcasm online.

### The evolution from :-) to 😂

Apple added an official emoji keyboard available outside Japan in 2011, a milestone that emoji experts credit as the true entrance of the characters into the American online lexicon.

By 2015, the face with tears of joy emoji 😂 was named the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year. This emoji remains the favorite among US users, according to an Adobe study.

### The future of emoji

Just as language evolves, so too have emoji.

Unicode puts out emoji set updates each September after sifting through submitted proposals and responding to global trends.

But Unicode has also faced criticism over the years for its lack of race, gender, sexuality and disability representation in earlier emoji sets, leading to the release of five skin tone options in 2015 and two gender options for professions in 2016. Accessibility emojis were added in 2019.

While there are now thousands of emoji options, the main usage remains loyal to the original goal 40 years ago of adding a smile and some levity.

As for Fahlman, he uses emojis "very, very rarely." Mostly, he said, "I prefer the little text ones, partly because they're my babies.
