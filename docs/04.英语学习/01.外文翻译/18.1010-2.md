Back from the brink: How 'frozen zoos' could save dying species
如悬崖勒马一般：为什么这个冰冻的公园可以保存灭绝中的物种？

When Kurt Benirschke started collecting skin samples from rare and endangered animals in 1972, he didn't have a firm plan on what to do with them. As a researcher at the University of California San Diego, he believed that one day the tools would be developed to use them to save those animals.
A few years later, he moved his collection to San Diego Zoo, and called it the Frozen Zoo. Today, the Frozen Zoo is the world's largest animal cryobank, with samples from over 10, 500 individual animals from 1, 220 species.
Since the Frozen Zoo was founded, many milestones have been reached in the field of genetics, starting with the cloning of the first animal — a sheep named Dolly — in 1996.
Starting in 2001, four endangered species have been cloned using genetic material from the Frozen Zoo: the Indian Gaur, a humpbacked Asian wild ox; the Banteng, a Southeast-Asian species of cattle; Przewalski's horse, once found throughout Mongolia and extinct in the wild until recently; and the Black-footed ferret, which was believed to be extinct in the wild until it resurfaced in 1981, but was then almost wiped out by an epidemic.
Although cloning isn't perfect, it's a useful tool to help save endangered species, because it can increase genetic diversity. When the population of a species dwindles, the remaining animals are forced to inbreed and the genetic pool shrinks, further threatening survival. In a species of animals, the genetic diversity is what gives it its resilience.
