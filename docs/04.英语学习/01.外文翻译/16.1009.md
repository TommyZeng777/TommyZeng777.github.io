What worries Iceland? A world without ice. It is preparing.

什么导致冰岛的担忧？一个没有冰的世界，正在准备变成现实。

Glaciers occupy over a tenth of Iceland. As temperatures rise across the Arctic nearly faster than any place on the planet, all of Iceland is considering the changing landscape and climate a matter of national urgency, and grappling with the prospect of a future with no ice.<!-- more -->

Energy producers are upgrading hydroelectric power plants and experimenting with burying carbon dioxide in rock to keep it out of the atmosphere. The fishing industry is slashing fossil fuel use with energy-efficient ships.

The government is budgeting $55 million over five years for reforestation, land conservation and carbon-free transport projects to slash greenhouse gas emissions. More will be spent by 2040, when Iceland expects businesses, organizations and individuals to be removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they put in.

"Climate change is no longer something to be joked about in Iceland or anywhere, " Gudni Jóhannesson, Iceland's president, said in an interview, adding that most Icelanders believe human activity plays a role. "We are taking responsibility to seek practical solutions. But we can do better, " he said.

Bigger nations like Norway and Finland have cut emissions more, and over 190 other countries except the United States have pledged to combat climate change under the Paris agreement. But with the impact in Iceland more visible than in other nations, it is doing what it can — while trying to turn the warming climate into an economic advantage.

"Let's look at practical solutions instead of being filled with despair, " Jóhannesson said.
