- Paris
  "**Sounds a bit cliche**, but Paris is the perfect city to enjoy fall because you can sit at any coffee place and feel immediately in an old rom-com movie or like you were a famous novel writer, " says writer Jennifer Padjemi in an email.

- Berlin
"Whereas summer may be the best time to experience Berlin's wide range of outdoor activities, fall is when Berliners turn to the other aspects that make this city so livable, " writes Rick Noack in an email. "Tourists and locals alike head to art exhibitions or reflect on the turbulent historic days of German reunification and the fall of the Berlin Wall."

- Dublin
"Dublin is beautiful in fall, " says Yvonne Gordon. "The trees all along the canals and rivers, and in parks like the Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green, turn yellow and gold, and the ground is carpeted with soft leaves. The autumn light is spectacular, especially early in the morning and in the evening. There's also a slight chill in the air, so knitted woolies come out, and the first crackling fires are lit."
