The group was born in the first few months of this year — out of disillusionment with 2021's COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow and in response to the government decision to expand oil and gas production in the North Sea and lift the ban on fracking.

> 这个组织诞生于今年最初的几个月里——在2021年举办于Glasgow的COP26气候变化会议里，

One of them, Morgan Trowland, a 39-year-old civil engineer, said the demonstration was helping to "reach the social tipping point we so urgently need" on climate change.

Professor Lorenzo Fioramonti, director of the University of Surrey's Institute for Sustainability, said JSO may have succeeded in getting publicity — but that won't translate into changes in policy.

"When it comes to this sort of activism, we need to differentiate between garnering visibility and garnering support, " he told Sky News. It also risks "dividing the ecological front" and "tainting the cause" of groups who are engaged in constructive dialogue with governments, fossil fuel producers and big business, he added.

JSO says it wants a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the UK over the next eight years. COP26 agreed on various targets to "phase them down" between 2030 and 2050. Until their demands are met, JSO has daily action planned throughout this month.

In response, the government is pursuing a new Public Order Bill to crack down on demonstrations that target essential infrastructure, creating bigger risks of being arrested, fined or imprisoned for JSO members.
