## 前言

就在最新的女篮世界杯上，中国女篮战胜了法国队（非洲队），挺进了四强。在此恭喜中国女篮，充分应验了妇女能顶半边天的我国优良价值体系。

在女同胞取得的骄人战绩的同时，突然翻到这篇19年中国男篮首轮出局的糗事，男同胞不能落后呀，要支楞起来。

再次恭喜女篮。<!-- more -->

> 在开局中圈跳球前，中国队就知道这场比赛只有胜利才可以接受，但在中场哨声响起时还是以33-23落后于对手。当赵继伟在中场休息前连续投进了两个三分球，东道主看到了一线希望，但委内瑞拉迅速的用两记三分球回击了中国队。

Fang Shuo stood out in the second half for China, but not enough. With a three and a jump shot, he led his team to **trim** the gap to five points with six minutes to go in the third quarter, the smallest **deficit** China had during the whole game.
