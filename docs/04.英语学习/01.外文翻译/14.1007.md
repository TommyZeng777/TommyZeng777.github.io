"I have been shamed my entire life for my weight and I am still fat. When nasty comments were made to me as a child I used to go home after school and eat food to make myself feel better.

Victoria also acknowledges the health impacts of obesity. "I have tried most of them and you just put the weight back on after the diet. Now I just try and do more exercise and eat healthier things."

"It's a very hard conversation to have, " Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at the University of Surrey, told the BBC.

"The evidence out there for the impact of excess bodyweight and obesity — on cancer, on diabetes, on heart disease — is very clear. And that's education we need to have out there."

"But because the line between getting that message out there and then actually making someone feel ashamed of who they are is so fine, those conversations are very difficult."
