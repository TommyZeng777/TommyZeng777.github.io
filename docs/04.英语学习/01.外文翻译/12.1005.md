::: note
文章的单词都不难，但是都特别长，经常会加很多的修饰成分，需要慢慢理解。
看完后觉得这篇文章质量一般般，就当图一乐

怀念小时候，几块钱就能买一堆零食，100块就觉得自己老有钱了。
工作之后，钱就总觉得不够花，巴不得月入100万，简单的幸福真好呀~

Ultimately, the money that caused his anxiety helped him and his wife out a lot when he experienced loss of income due to his health. It helps his family have more of what they value the most — time together.

> 最终，这些引起他的焦虑的钱在他亲历了因为健康缘故损失收入时，对他和他的妻子帮助很大。这让他的家庭拥有了更多他们最看重的东西——在一起相处的时间。

"Money **certainly** gives us more of that, " says Ford. "It gives us security that we'll have more of that in the future and feeling secure in that makes me feel wealthy."

> Ford说到：“钱当然给我们的远多于一起相处的时间，它给了我们安全感，我们将在未来拥有更多的这样的东西并且感到安全，这让我感到富有。”
