Americans splurge on beauty, despite pullbacks elsewhere

美国人在美妆上肆意挥霍，却在别处削减开支

Many major retailers **slashed** their financial outlooks for the year after seeing **shoppers** pull back on many **discretionary items** in the latest quarter. But among the **notable** **exceptions**: beauty.<!-- more -->

> 在很多消费者都在最近这一季度减少了生活费必需品的开之后，很多大型零售商大幅下调了今年的财务预期。
>
> 但是除了明显的例外：美妆行业
>
> slashed：大幅下降
>
> shopper：购物者
>
> discretionary items：生活非必需品，discretionary：自主选择的反过来说就是可要可不要
>
> notable：显著的
>
> exception：例外

Ulta Beauty, the largest beauty **retailer** in the country, said **overall sales** **spiked** nearly 17% in its most **recent quarter**, compared to the **same period** last year.

> 犹他美容，美国最大的彩妆零售商，称在最近一季度总销售额相比去年同期大幅度上涨了接近17%。
>
> retailer：零售商
>
> overall sales：总销售额
>
> spiked：v.（通常指在下跌前）上升至非常高的位置（作名词表示尖头、尖刺）
>
> recent quarter：最近一个季度
>
> same period：同一时期

A possible explanation for why beauty is thriving when consumers are more apprehensive about their spending is a long-held theory known as the "lipstick index, " which posits that lipstick sales rise during times of economic downturn.

> 对于这种出现在消费者非常有消费担忧时期的现象，一种可能的解释是一个长期存在的叫做“口红指数”理论，一个对于口红会在经济低迷时期销量增加的假设。

The reasoning goes: When consumer sentiment declines, Americans seek escapism by looking for small ways to indulge themselves, such as by purchasing a new lipstick instead of pricier alternatives they can no longer afford.
The lipstick theory has held, though not always.

Makeup sales spiked during the Great Depression and the recession in the early 2000s.

But sales declined during the 2008 economic collapse, according to market research firm NPD Group. The same happened during the early days of the pandemic as Americans stayed home — or behind masks — and shifted their interests towards wellness and skincare.

Now, makeup is roaring back. Americans have bought more eye, face and lip makeup — roughly 2%, 5% and 12% respectively — in a year-over-year analysis of sales across stores.

"Customers are not willing to give up their beauty purchases, " Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass recently told the Associated Press. "People need to feel good at this time with so much pressure on them."
